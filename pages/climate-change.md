## Evidence for Climate Change

Pieces of evidence:

- **Scientific Consensus -** There is an overwhelming scientific and organizational consensus affirming the legitimacy of the anthropogenic global warming thesis, the idea that the temperature of the earth is increasing and that this is heavily caused by humans<ref>Scientific consensus - NASA Science. (n.d.). https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/scientific-consensus/</ref><ref>California, S. O. (n.d.). List of worldwide scientific organizations - Office of Planning and Research. https://www.opr.ca.gov/facts/list-of-scientific-organizations.html</ref><ref>Anderegg, W. R. L., Prall, J. W., Harold, J., & Schneider, S. H. (2010). Expert credibility in climate change. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 107(27), 12107–12109. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1003187107</ref><ref>Cook, J., Nuccitelli, D., Green, S. A., Richardson, M., Winkler, B., Painting, R., Way, R., Jacobs, P., & Skuce, A. (2013). Quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming in the scientific literature. Environmental Research Letters, 8(2), 024024. https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024</ref><ref>IPCC reflects scientific consensus on climate change. (n.d.). Skeptical Science. https://skepticalscience.com/Hulme-IPCC-consensus.htm</ref><ref>The Cook et al. (2013) 97% consensus result is robust. (n.d.). Skeptical Science. https://skepticalscience.com/97-percent-consensus-robust.htm</ref><ref>Powell, J. (2017). Scientists reach 100% consensus on anthropogenic global warming. Bulletin of Science Technology & Society, 37(4), 183–184. https://doi.org/10.1177/0270467619886266</ref>.

- **Climate Model Accuracy -** While it is the case that short-term weather forecasts are bad at predicting future weather events and temperatures, climate models which look in the long-term have been as a whole very accurate at measuring temperature trends over time<ref>IPCC global surface warming projections have been accurate. (n.d.). Skeptical Science. https://skepticalscience.com/ipcc-global-warming-projections.htm</ref><ref>Hausfather, Z., Drake, H. F., Abbott, T., & Schmidt, G. A. (2020). Evaluating the performance of past climate model projections. Geophysical Research Letters, 47(1). https://doi.org/10.1029/2019gl085378</ref>. The reason why weather can't really be predicted with current modelling while climate can is because climate models take the average of a number of weather events over time and use that to predict mean temperature trends<ref>How reliable are climate models? (n.d.). Skeptical Science. https://skepticalscience.com/climate-models.htm</ref>. This is similar to how a person can't with certainty predict the outcome of a coin toss but can predict the number of heads and tails of a coin toss over a large number of trials with a fair degree of certainty. Moreover, it should be noted that, at least regarding the IPCC predictions, sea level rise and arctic sea ice models have underestimated the climate response, as they failed to take into account positive feedback loops that exist with such phenomena.

## Effects of Climate Change

- **Planetary Boundaries Hypothesis -** Some climatic variables have global thresholds which if crossed will have qualitatively negative material effects for people, such as ocean acidification, climate change, and potentially the phosphorous cycle and stratospheric ozone depletion. However, some others don't including land-use change, biodiversity loss, nitrogen cycle, global freshwater use, atmospheric aerosol loading, and chemical pollution<ref>The Planetary Boundaries Hypothesis: A Review of the evidence. (n.d.). ResearchGate. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276278487_The_Planetary_Boundaries_Hypothesis_A_Review_of_the_Evidence</ref>.

### Environmental

- **Temperature -** Earth's temperature has risen by an average of 0.08° Celsius per decade since 1880 or about 2° F in total. Since 1981, the rate of warming has doubled to 0.18° C per decade. The 10 warmest years in the historical record have all occurred since 2010<ref>Climate change: global temperature. (2024, January 18). NOAA Climate.gov. https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-temperature</ref>.
- **Biological -** Plants and animals cannot adapt to the rapidly changing climatic conditions that humans have caused<ref>Can animals and plants adapt to global warming? (n.d.). Skeptical Science. https://skepticalscience.com/Can-animals-and-plants-adapt-to-global-warming.htm</ref>. Warming is happening at a rate 20-60 times higher than natural ice age temperature changes. The extinction rate for species is 100-1000 times higher than normal. Even ignoring temperature changes, human civilizations cause migration, a common adaptive behavior to be a more difficult option, and the introduction of invasive species and deforestation also increase the vulnerability of species. Moreover, climatic changes are likely to be too fast for humans to adapt. Currently, 1% of the earth's land is considered in barely livable heat, with most of it in the Sahara and other hot desert regions. By 2070, with unmitigated CO2 emissions, this could jump up to 19%. Parts of the US could have a month's worth of dangerously hot "wet bulb" temperatures by 2050, which prevent the body from cooling off through sweating.
- **Droughts -** Droughts have increased in frequency worldwide and have become more intense<ref>Hille, K. B. (2023, September 29). NASA finds drought in eastern Mediterranean worst of past 900 years - NASA. NASA. https://www.nasa.gov/technology/nasa-finds-drought-in-eastern-mediterranean-worst-of-past-900-years/</ref><ref>Marvel, K., Cook, B. I., Bonfils, C. J. W., Durack, P. J., Smerdon, J. E., & Williams, A. P. (2019). Twentieth-century hydroclimate changes consistent with human influence. Nature, 569(7754), 59–65. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1149-8</ref>. Projections indicate that these will likely increase over time<ref>NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, Ocean and Climate Physics, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, & Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, Cornell University. (2015). Unprecedented 21st century drought risk in the American Southwest and Central Plains. Sci. Adv., 1, e1400082. https://www.science.org/doi/pdf/10.1126/sciadv.1400082</ref>. Although these projections look at one region of the United States, it seems reasonable to assert similar trends will likely occur in other places given the increased droughts worldwide. Increases in droughts that have already occurred have likely caused or contributed to conflict in already unstable regions, with Kelley et al. (2014) finding that the 2007-2010 drought contributed to the conflict in Syria<ref>Kelley, C. P., Mohtadi, S., Cane, M. A., Seager, R., & Kushnir, Y. (2015). Climate change in the Fertile Crescent and implications of the recent Syrian drought. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 112(11), 3241–3246. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1421533112</ref>.
- **Wildfires -** Climate change increases the risk of wildfires occurring<ref>Climate change increases the risk of wildfires confirms new review. (2020, January 20). ScienceDaily. https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/01/200114074046.htm</ref>. Fire weather patterns have increased on 25% of the earth's vegetated surface, and a 20% increase in the global mean length of the fire season. While humans cannot stop high-risk fire weather from occurring, through land management decisions and ignition sources, they can significantly decrease the harm of wildfires and the probability that they will sprout up. In the rocky mountains, there has been significant decreases in the level of tree regeneration in the 21st century, due to decreased moisture<ref>Stevens‐Rumann, C. S., Kemp, K. B., Higuera, P. E., Harvey, B. J., Rother, M. T., Donato, D. C., Morgan, P., & Veblen, T. T. (2017). Evidence for declining forest resilience to wildfires under climate change. Ecology Letters, 21(2), 243–252. https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.12889</ref>.
- **Ocean -** Between 1900 and 2015 the sea level has risen an average 8 inches. Currently, it is rising at about an eighth of an inch per year, although this is expected to exponentially grow in the years to come. By 2100, it is projected that sea level will rise another 1-8 feet<ref>How is sea level rise related to climate change? (n.d.). https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/sealevelclimate.html</ref>. Even under the 1.5 degrees scenario, sea level rise is still expected to go over several meters over the next thousand years. The 2 degrees threshold would result in a 9-meter sea level rise. Economic costs in the world's largest coastal cities due to flooding in 2005 were $6 billion, in the year of Hurricane Katrina. This is expected to jump up to $1 trillion by 2050<ref>Reducing carbon emissions will limit sea level rise. (2018, July 18). ScienceDaily. https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/07/180716130724.htm</ref>.

### Anthropocentric

- **Disease -** Climate change will lead to an increase in the spread of a variety of diseases<ref>Towers, S., Chowell, G., Hameed, R., Jastrebski, M., Khan, M., Meeks, J., Mubayi, A., & Harris, G. (2013). Climate change and influenza: the likelihood of early and severe influenza seasons following warmer than average winters.

Global expansion and redistribution of Aedes-borne virus transmission risk with climate change. PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases, 13(3), e0007213. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0007213</ref>.
- **Economic -** Climate damages are estimated to be between 2.5-7.5% of GDP in 2050, and already over the past few decades have been found to cost a few percent of global GDP annually. Investment into mitigation will likely rise in the short to medium term, but this will be unproductive investment as it is replacing existing capital<ref>Nixon, J. & Oxford Economics. (2019). THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF GLOBAL WARMING. https://www.cheshirescouts.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/The-economic-impact-of-global-warming-Oxford-Economics.pdf</ref>. However, the benefits of adaptation policies may end up increasing GDP and paying for themselves<ref>The Economic Consequences of Climate Change | READ online. (n.d.). oecd-ilibrary.org. https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/environment/the-economic-consequences-of-climate-change_9789264235410-en#page14</ref><ref>What’s more costly, climate action or inaction? (n.d.). Skeptical Science. https://skepticalscience.com/too-expensive-intermediate.htm</ref>.
- **Health -** Air pollution kills an estimated 7 million people every year<ref>World Health Organization: WHO. (2019, July 30). Air pollution. https://www.who.int/health-topics/air-pollution#tab=tab_1</ref>. Death rates from air pollution worldwide have been decreasing since 1990<ref>https://assets.ourworldindata.org/grapher/exports/death-rate-by-source-from-air-pollution.svg</ref>. An emissions reduction to a 2 degrees scenario would cause an estimated 153 million fewer premature deaths, with about 40% occurring over the next 40 years<ref>Shindell, D., Faluvegi, G., Seltzer, K., & Shindell, C. (2018). Quantified, localized health benefits of accelerated carbon dioxide emissions reductions. Nature Climate Change, 8(4), 291–295. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-018-0108-y</ref>. The impact of climate change in 2100 will be comparable to leading causes of death such as cancer and infectious disease (this was before COVID existed)<ref>https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/BFI_WP_201851.pdf</ref>. Vohra et al. (2021) estimates a global total of 10.2 million premature deaths annually from fossil fuel combustion<ref>Vohra, K., Vodonos, A., Schwartz, J., Marais, E. A., Sulprizio, M. P., & Mickley, L. J. (2021). Global mortality from outdoor fine particle pollution generated by fossil fuel combustion: Results from GEOS-Chem. Environmental Research, 195, 110754. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.110754</ref>. Reducing greenhouse gas emission can help reduce deaths associated with air pollution<ref>UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health. (2017, October 31). Can we reduce deaths associated with air pollution? - UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health. https://sph.unc.edu/cphm/can-we-reduce-deaths-associated-with-air-pollution/</ref>.
- **Conflict/Stability -** Each standard deviation in temperature increases interpersonal conflict by 2.4% and intergroup conflict by 11.3%<ref>Burke, M., Hsiang, S. M., & Miguel, E. (2015). Climate and conflict. Annual Review of Economics, 7(1), 577–617. https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-economics-080614-115430</ref>. Climate change threatens to cause the largest refugee crisis in human history, at over 200 million people largely in Africa and Asia. The majority of these are predicted to occur over the latter half of this century<ref>Biermann, F., & Boas, I. (2010). Preparing for a warmer world: Towards a global governance system to protect climate refugees. Global Environmental Politics, 10(1), 60–88. https://doi.org/10.1162/glep.2010.10.1.60</ref>. Under an expected climate change scenario, there could be heightened global tensions due to large-scale migrations, conflict over resource scarcity, increased disease proliferation, geopolitical shifts, and societal reactions. This would be exacerbated under more extreme climate change scenarios<ref>Campbell, K. M., Gulledge, J., McNeill, J. R., Podesta, J., Ogden, P., Fuerth, L., Woolsey, R. J., Lennon, A. T. J., Smith, J., Weitz, R., Mix, D., & Center for StrategiC & international StudieS. (2007).

- **Inequality -** The vast majority of CO2 emissions come from the richest people on the planet, who are the ones who will suffer from the effects the least. 50% of emissions are attributable to the richest 10%, who emit 60 times more CO2 than the poorest 10%<ref>Oxfam.

Despite being the people who contribute the least to climate change, the poor will be most negatively affected by climate change<ref>How are the poor impacted by climate change? (n.d.). Skeptical Science. https://skepticalscience.com/co2-limits-poor-poverty.htm</ref>.

## Mitigative Behavior

Gifford (2011) identified a large number of psychological barriers that impede pro-environmental behavior. These can be divided into 7 categories: limited cognition about the problem, ideological worldviews, comparisons with others, sunk costs and behavioral momentum, discredence toward experts and authorities, perceived risks of change, and positive but inadequate behavior change<ref>The Dragons of Inaction: Psychological barriers that limit climate change mitigation and adaptation. (n.d.). ResearchGate. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254734365_The_Dragons_of_Inaction_Psychological_Barriers_That_Limit_Climate_Change_Mitigation_and_Adaptation</ref>.

A belief in the scientific consensus on climate change acts as a gateway belief which causes a belief that climate change is happening, is human-caused, and is worrisome. These are in turn predictive of increased support for public action<ref>Van Der Linden, S. L., Leiserowitz, A. A., Feinberg, G. D., & Maibach, E. W. (2015). The scientific consensus on climate change as a gateway belief: experimental evidence. PLoS ONE, 10(2), e0118489. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0118489</ref>.

## Solutions

### Energy Transition

The effects of energy policies and environmental regulation on employment are unclear, but they appear to have small but positive effects on employment<ref>Pestel, N. (2014). Employment effects of green energy policies. IZA World of Labor. https://doi.org/10.15185/izawol.76</ref><ref>Horbach, J. (2016). Impacts of regulation on eco-innovation and job creation. IZA World of Labor. https://doi.org/10.15185/izawol.265</ref><ref>Renewable energy creates more jobs than fossil fuels. (n.d.). Skeptical Science. https://skepticalscience.com/renewable-energy-investment-kills-jobs.htm</ref>. Additionally, they decrease air polluting, which increases health and labor productivity. Keep in mind that this is a net effect. As a transition occurs to more green energy policies and energy sources there are people in the fossil fuel industry who will become unemployed. These people's interests should be considered in any green energy policy through short-run retraining programs and long-run shifts in the educational system<ref>Wayback machine. (n.d.). https://web.archive.org/web/20240414044922/https://www.oecd.org/environment/Employment-Implications-of-Green-Growth-OECD-Report-G7-Environment-Ministers.pdf</ref>. Income support is also important.

### Willingness to Pay

To combat climate change, 57% of Americans were willing to pay a dollar a month, while 23% were willing to pay a monthly fee of $40<ref>Admin, P. (2020, July 1). Is the Public Willing to Pay to Help Fix Climate Change? - AP-NORC. AP-NORC -. https://apnorc.org/projects/is-the-public-willing-to-pay-to-help-fix-climate-change/</ref>.

### Agricultural Subsidies

Agricultural subsidies distort market prices, interfere with trade, adversely affect poor farmers in developing countries, burden US taxpayers, and lead to environmental degradation<ref>Ostria, M. (2013). How U.S. agricultural subsidies harm the environment, taxpayers and the poor. https://www.ncpathinktank.org/pdfs/ib126.pdf</ref>.

### Renewables

Bioelectricity from burning crop and plantation forest residues and solar power with low-cost thermal storage can already provide baseload energy as good as fossil fuels. Intermittency can be solved through interconnecting power lines across geographical regions to account for individual variability, while coupling them with peak-load plants such as gas turbines fueled by biofuels or natural gas which can be quickly turned on to fill in gaps of low wind and solar production. Numerous regional and global case studies have outlined realistic plans which allow us to meet 100% of energy demand with renewable sources<ref>Can renewables provide baseload power? (n.d.). Skeptical Science. https://skepticalscience.com/renewable-energy-baseload-power-advanced.htm</ref>.

Nuclear energy is one of the safest sources of energy in terms of its death rate from accidents and air pollution<ref>Ritchie, H., & Roser, M. (2024, March 20). What are the safest and cleanest sources of energy? Our World in Data. https://ourworldindata.org/safest-sources-of-energy</ref>.

The total cost to implement mitigation efforts to essentially half estimated CO2 in 2030 is less than 1% of projected global GDP once taking into account investment which will pay for itself<ref>Ritchie, H., Rosado, P., Samborska, V., & Roser, M. (2024, April 15). Climate change. Our World in Data. https://ourworldindata.org/climate-change</ref>.

There are numerous barriers to renewable energy usage in the United States. These include upfront capital costs, reliability misconceptions, an unequal playing field due to subsidies of fossil fuels, a well-established existing market, and problems with where to put decentralized plants and how the energy will be transmitted to power lines<ref>Barriers to renewable energy technologies. (2014, June 6). Union of Concerned Scientists. https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/barriers-renewable-energy-technologies#.W-s1fN-YVuR</ref>.
