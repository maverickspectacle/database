## Effects

Eskildsen & Bj√∏rnskov (2020) looked at a panel of 162 countries between 1970-2016 and found that discussion freedom is unambiguously associated with less terrorism in democracies<ref>https://futurefreespeech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Freedom-of-Expression-and-Terror-Apr-4.pdf</ref>. Another study suggested that there is no connection between the protection of freedom of expression and radicalization and terror<ref>http://justitia-int.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Analyse_Ytringsfrihed-Hvad-skal-det-nytte.pdf</ref>. Concern about societal conflict and violence arising from freedom of expression only finds empirical support in the most closed societies, where limited liberalizations of freedom of expression may be able to promote societal conflict. The same study suggested that freedom of expression is associated with general protection of human rights, lower levels of corruption, better democratic conditions, and increased innovation. This is consistent with the idea that most restrictions on freedom of expression are used as a tool to safeguard the interests of society's most powerful people.

It should be noted however that we have to be careful about how the notion of freedom of speech/expression is operationalized. Both studies discussed above put Denmark at the top of the list for freedom of expression, because while the country has generally high acceptance of restrictions on freedom of expression when it comes to minority groups of radical political and religious movements, it also has the highest support for the protection of freedom of expression. This means that it is dubious to use this data to argue against hate speech laws, as it appears that they aren't looking at that as a major issue when it comes to ranking countries.
