## Intelligence

### G Factor

The there exists a general intelligence, or g factor, which is highly heritable<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15651931/</ref><ref>https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0160289614000099</ref>. General cognitive ability can predict academic performance, career potential, creativity, and job performance<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.86.1.148</ref>. There is expert consensus that g is an important non-trivial predictor or determinant of important real world outcomes, and that g tests are valid and generally do not have racial bias<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2008.03.007</ref>.

Rats display a general factor of intelligence<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8510832/</ref>, as well as dogs<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016028961630023X</ref>. The g factor also exists amongst chimpanzees, and the more g-loaded cognitive abilities had more genetic variance and phenotypic variance and were more heritable, suggesting it is associated with high interspecies variance and evolves rapidly<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2015.04.002</ref>.

This general factor has been shown to also exist in international cognitive ability comparisons, suggesting it is a universal phenomenon<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/per.634</ref><ref>https://emilkirkegaard.dk//en/wp-content/uploads/The-g-factor-of-international-cognitive-ability-comparisons-the-homogeneity-of-results-in-PISA-TIMSS-PIRLS-and-IQ-tests-across-nations.pdf</ref><ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2019-01683-001.pdf</ref>.

In higher ability populations, cognitive ability tests are less correlated with one another and less g loaded<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5669751/</ref>.

### Heritability

Intelligence is highly heritable at as high as 0.8<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5754247/</ref>. There are a very high number of genetic loci which have been found to be associated with intelligence<ref>https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3869</ref><ref>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04362-x?ref=iqpredictionnews</ref><ref>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.024554v3.full.pdf</ref>. High intelligence is also familial, heritable, and caused by the same genetic and environmental factors responsible for the normal distribution of intelligence<ref>https://files.catbox.moe/xd769q.pdf</ref>. Additionally, intellectual disability is heritable at 51%<ref>https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcpp.13560</ref>. Similarly, educational attainment is reasonably heritable<ref>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-69526-6</ref><ref>https://files.catbox.moe/3t8uvr.pdf</ref>.

**Wilson Effect:** The heritability of IQ increases with age, reaching a maximum of about 0.6-0.8<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/figure/A-meta-analysis-of-11000-pairs-of-twins-shows-that-the-heritability-of-intelligence_fig1_265690996</ref>.

### Bias/Alternative Theories

Possible sources of bias:

- **Test Anxiety -** Test anxiety does not induce measurement bias in aptitude and cognitive ability test scores<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2007.11.003</ref><ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2015.08.007</ref><ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lindif.2016.06.030</ref>. Rather, test anxiety is most closely related to psychometric g<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2013.11.003</ref>.
- **Test-Retest Gains -** IQ test-retest score gains are correlated with g loadings at -1, meaning that score gains are not g-loaded at all<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2006.07.006</ref><ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2018.10.004</ref>.

Alternative views of intelligence:

- **Emotional Intelligence -** Emotional intelligence can be reduced to g, personality trait agreeableness, and sex<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2003.11.014</ref>.
- **Multiple Intelligences -** Highly diverse tests of purely cognitive abilities are strongly g-loaded, suggesting that multiple intelligences do not exist<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2006.02.004</ref>.

### Correlates

Individual-Level:

- **Crime -** Research suggests that intelligence is correlated with crime, most research suggesting independently of socio-economics status<ref>https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2123&context=jclc</ref><ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1745-9125.1996.tb01220.x</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886911000912</ref>. This predictive validity of IQ persists in cross-state comparisons<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886909005169</ref>. This relationship, however, is not perfectly linear. People who have very low intelligence have slightly lower criminality than people with fairly low intelligence, and people with very high intelligence have slightly higher criminality than people with fairly high intelligence<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016028961500077X</ref><ref>https://clcjbooks.rutgers.edu/books/criminal-genius-a-portrait-of-high-iq-offenders/</ref>. There is a small negative relationship between IQ and rearrest<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29954769/</ref>. Estimates of IQ across states and counties have shown to be negatively correlated with crime<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19529925/</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289613000190</ref>.
- **Individual Income/Wealth -** There is a relationship between an individual’s intelligence level and their future income. People with higher intelligence levels tend to have higher incomes<ref>https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=d6fdb1364dc3e73c44441ba55a15f1b9bc49265a</ref><ref>https://ifstudies.org/blog/can-intelligence-predict-income</ref>. Importantly, however, this relationship does not appear to translate perfectly in terms of total wealth. While intelligence predicts higher income, it has a quadratic relationship with financial distress<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289607000219</ref>. Therefore, it is not entirely clear how much net wealth is affected by intelligence. IQ is a better predictor of socioeconomic success than parental SES or grades<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11334871/</ref>. IQ and conscientiousness are also more important than SES for educational attainment<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11916378/</ref><ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11058498/</ref><ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29611892/</ref>. Maynard & Murnane (1979) looked at the impact of a negative income tax experiment and found that it increased the average reading achievement of children in grades 4 through 6, but not for older children<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25328893/</ref>. Similarly, Duncan et al. (2011) conducted a random monetary assignment experiment and found that an increase in annual income results in a substantial increase in young children's achievement<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28081903/</ref>. Financial stress can temporarily lower IQ<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32188746/</ref>. Childhood IQ is associated with class mobility in adulthood across all social classes<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32661290/</ref>. Polygenic scores have been identified that are associated with social mobility<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29049045/</ref>.
- **Educational Attainment -** Intelligence is a major predictor of school achievements, partially through more intelligent people having higher levels of motivation to succeed in school environments<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289615001269</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1747938X18300691</ref>. Students attending selective schools tend to outperform their non-selective counterparts in national exams. However, there are substantial mean genetic differences between students of different school types on a polygenic score associated with higher education. After controlling for factors involved in pupil selection, there were no significant genetic differences between school types, and the variance in exam scores explained by school type dropped to less than 1%. This suggests that genetic and exam differences between school types are primarily due to heritable characteristics involved in pupil admission<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12578471/</ref>. Experiments suggest that the effects of interventions that raise IQ fade away following the intervention because children who receive the interventions lose their IQ advantage<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25281007/</ref>. Headstart gains are correlated at -0.8 with g loadings, suggesting that headstart gains are generally not on the g factor<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289614000932</ref>. Schooling gains are not g loaded<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31109385/</ref>.
- **Adoption -** Adopted siblings or peers have higher IQ scores than their nonadopted siblings or peers who stayed behind<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15740423/</ref>. These effects are not g-loaded<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886914005248</ref>.
- **Lead -** There is an inverse relationship between blood lead concentration and IQ and reading test scores<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1257652/</ref><ref>https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w22558/w22558.pdf</ref>. These effects are g loaded<ref>https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2018.09.005</ref>.
- **Health -** Higher intelligence is associated with a substantially lower risk of death, even after adjusting for childhood and adult socioeconomic status as well as education, although adult SES and education attenuate it substantially<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyq190</ref>. Research suggests that this effect is mostly genetic in origin<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyv112</ref>.
- **Fertility -** There is a small negative correlation between cognitive ability and fertility among modern humans<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/0160-2896(95)90012-8</ref><ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2017.05.002</ref>. There is strong assortative mating for intelligence<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09567976231105382</ref>. Intelligence is positively associated with childlessness<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25546071/</ref>. There exists a Jensen effect on dysgenic fertility, meaning that the more g loaded a test score is, the more it is associated with lower fertility<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32184024/</ref>. Polygenic scores that predict higher earnings, education and health also predict lower fertility<ref>https://files.catbox.moe/41zw1p.pdf</ref>. This may suggest that earnings-increasing human capital may either increase or decrease fertility through income and substitution effects in the labor market.
- **Brain Size/Chemistry -** Brain size is positively associated with g<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32076418/</ref><ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25855618/</ref><ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31473014/</ref>. This is of genetic origin as whole-brain gray and white matter is highly heritable<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32286890/</ref>, and there is a genetic correlation between intracranial volume and years of education<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32286899/</ref>, as well as intelligence<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15922990/</ref>. Human intelligence can be predicted with some accuracy using neuroimaging techniques<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14749147/</ref><ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25546071/</ref>.
- **Conspiracism -** General cognitive ability is associated with a lower inclination to believe various conspiracies and paranormal phenomena, but only among individuals who strongly value epistemic rationality<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30624183/</ref>.
- **Reaction Times -** Reaction time tasks correlate with psychometric intelligence<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29795215/</ref>.
- **SAT -** The SAT is strongly correlated with g<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00687.x</ref>. Coaching has a small but positive effect on SAT scores<ref>https://meridian.allenpress.com/her/article-abstract/53/1/1/31190/Evaluating-the-Effect-of-Coaching-on-SAT-Scores-A?redirectedFrom=fulltext</ref>.
- **Inbreeding -** Inbreeding is related to a lower intelligence, with the effects of inbreeding depression being most strongly correlated with the subtest's g loading<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/0191-8869(83)90054-5</ref>.
- **Creativity -** There is a small and heterogeneous positive correlation between IQ and creativity<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30009212/</ref>.

**National-Level:** National IQ is correlated with a variety of educational, cognitive, economic, political, demographic, sociological, geographic, and climate variables<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27866536/</ref>. National IQ is positively correlated with economic development, and is the best predictor of economic growth<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29328072/</ref><ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30191806/</ref>. Education and cognitive ability appear to be more important as developmental factors for GDP than economic freedom. Education and intelligence are more relevant to economic welfare than vice versa, but economic welfare also predicts education and intelligence<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28201577/</ref>. A 1 point increase in a nation's average IQ is associated with a persistent 0.11% annual increase in per-capita GDP<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8721.2006.00439.x</ref>. IQ is also associated with the production and exportation of more sophisticated/complex products<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289612001134</ref>. IQ is also a significant predictor of financial development<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2015.03.007</ref>.

### Flynn Effect

The average decadal IQ increase since 1951 has been 2.6 points<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4152423/</ref>. The Flynn effect is negatively correlated with g loadings at -0.38, suggesting the Flynn effect is not g loaded and that group differences and the Flynn effect have different causes<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289613000226</ref>. After correcting for increased guessing, the correlation between the flynn effect and g loadings goes down to -0.82<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289613001761</ref>.

## Political Orientation

### Principles

- **Conformity -** Individuals tend to conform to the group's opinion or censor their views in situations where people deliberately disagree with them. Conformity and censorship are most frequent among introverted, emotionally stable, and racial minority participants<ref>https://scholarworks.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1029&context=honorstheses</ref>.
- **Knowledge -** Ignorance of policy-specific information leads many to hold political views they wouldn't hold otherwise. This effect is greatest for those with the highest levels of political knowledge<ref>https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/abs/political-ignorance-and-collective-policy-preferences/D4E790DE0197D8430A03D9B8993F199B</ref>.
- **Modelling Ideology -** A unidimensional model of ideology is incomplete when studying political ideology, as economic and social views have different determinants, suggesting that a model of ideology should have at least two dimensions to it<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pops.12055</ref>.

### Heritability

Political views appear to be roughly 40% heritable<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10519-014-9648-8</ref>, if not more<ref>https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2013/12/09/study-on-twins-suggests-our-political-beliefs-may-be-hard-wired/</ref>. This varies heavily with political sophistication, with people high in political sophistication having an estimated heritability of political views of 74%<ref>https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-experimental-political-science/article/genes-ideology-and-sophistication/91C7C343BBA8801732F62E7D55B16676</ref>. There is significant genetic overlap between political views and a variety of psychological traits, such as cognitive ability and personality<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154620300553</ref>, suggesting that much of these beliefs are byproducts of indirectly related psychological characteristics.

### Correlates

**Cognitive Correlates:**

- **Intelligence -** Libertarians (economically right-wing, socially left-wing) tend to be the most intelligent<ref>https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0042366</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289614000373</ref><ref>https://www.econlib.org/archives/2015/01/intelligence_ma_1.html</ref><ref>https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emil-O-W-Kirkegaard/publication/313890514_Cognitive_Ability_and_Political_Preferences_in_Denmark/links/58adc44b92851cf7ae85ac79/Cognitive-Ability-and-Political-Preferences-in-Denmark.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289618300667</ref><ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/01461672211046808</ref>, followed by liberals (economically and socially left-wing) and then conservatives (economically and socially right-wing)<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1002/per.2027</ref>. This appears to be due to beliefs in personal and economic liberalism both being correlated with intelligence. However, this effect varies across cultures<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289611001425</ref>, and there is evidence to suggest that a lot of the relationship between ideology and intelligence is a function of which beliefs are mainstream, with mainstream beliefs being associated with higher intelligence<ref>https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/unique-everybody-else/201305/intelligence-and-politics-have-complex-relationship</ref>. More intelligent people tend to be more ideologically intolerant<ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-55298-001</ref>. Belief superiority is better predicted by extremity of political beliefs than by partisan affiliation<ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2013-44136-012</ref>. Conservatives tend to be more ideologically intolerant than liberals, and extreme ideologists tend to be more ideologically intolerant than moderate ideologists<ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-55298-001</ref>. Greater political knowledge is associated with affective polarization<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/20570473211063237</ref>. Intelligence is also associated with thinking more like economists, who tend to among other things, trust market mechanisms<ref>https://econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/pdfs/intelligencethinklike.pdf</ref>. Cognitive ability is positively related to both personal liberalism and economic liberalism<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emil_O_W_Kirkegaard/publication/313890514_Cognitive_Ability_and_Political_Preferences_in_Denmark/links/58adc44b92851cf7ae85ac79/Cognitive-Ability-and-Political-Preferences-in-Denmark.pdf</ref>. There exists a general factor of personal liberalism and economic liberalism.
- **Cognitive Bias -** Both conservatives and liberals have motivated disbelief in political problems when averse to the solutions of such problems, such as conservatives not believing in climate change<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25347128/</ref>. Ditto et al. (2019) meta-analyzed the results of 51 experimental studies and found that liberals and conservatives had the same level of tendency to evaluate otherwise identical information more favorably when it supports one's political beliefs or allegiances than when it challenges those beliefs or allegiances<ref>https://cpb-us-e2.wpmucdn.com/faculty.sites.uci.edu/dist/c/602/files/2019/08/Ditto-et-al.-2018-Perspectives-on-Psychological-Science-paper.pdf</ref>. People perceive the world in a manner consistent with their political views, meaning there is a selective pattern of learning in which partisans have higher levels of knowledge for facts that confirm their worldview and lower levels of knowledge for facts that challenge them<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1017/s0022381612000187</ref>. Liberals tend to be better at identifying flawed arguments supporting conservative beliefs while conservatives tend to be better at identifying flawed arguments supporting liberal beliefs<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1948550619829059</ref>. Conservatives and liberals have similar levels of desires to remain in their respective ideological bubbles<ref>https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2953780</ref>. Both liberals and conservatives find Stephen Colbert funny, but conservatives are more likely to report that Colbert only pretends to be joking and genuinely means what he says while liberals are more likely to report that Colbert used satire and was not serious when offering political statements. Conservatism also significantly predicted perceptions that Colbert disliked liberalism<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1940161208330904</ref>.

**Personality Correlates:**

- **General Personality -** Right-wingers tend to have lower openness and higher conscientiousness compared to left-wingers. There is also some evidence suggesting right-wingers also tend to have lower neuroticism and agreeableness, and higher extraversion<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656612001158?via%3Dihub</ref><ref>https://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1109&context=tdr</ref>. The correlation between personality traits and political orientation is a function of an innate common genetic factor, as opposed to being causal in one direction or another<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3809096/#:~:text=The%20results%20suggest%20that%20personality,innate%20common%20underlying%20genetic%20factor</ref>. Conservatives and liberals also have equal levels of narcissism, although they differ in the ways in which narcissists of each orientation tend to express their narcissism, where conservatives are more entitled and liberals are more exhibitionistic<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajps.12380</ref>.
- **Dark Triad -** Individuals with dark triad traits (narcissism, machivaellianism, and psychopathy) more frequently signal virtuous victimhood, even after controlling for demographic and socioeconomic variables that are more commonly associated with victimhood. Victim signalling is associated with amoral manipulation and a narcissism of one's belief in their superior prosociality, and also predicts a person's willingness to engage in and endorse many ethically questionable behaviors, such as lying to earn a bonus<ref>https://scottbarrykaufman.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Ok-et-al.-2020.pdf</ref>.
- **Need for Security -** Needs for security and certainty generally yield culturally conservative but economically left-wing values<ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0036170</ref>. Death anxiety, system instability, dogmatism and intolerance of ambiguity, needs for order, structure, and closure, and fear of threat and loss all positively predict political conservatism, while uncertainty tolerance, integrative complexity, and self-esteem negatively predict political conservatism<ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2003-00782-003</ref>. The brains of right-wingers/conservatives tend to be more reactive to fear, aversive stimuli, sudden noises, and threatening visual images<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18801995/</ref><ref>https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(11)00289-2</ref><ref>https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2011.0268#aff-1</ref>.
- **Emotional Abilities -** Emotional abilities are significantly and negatively related to socio-cultural and economic-hierarchical right-wing attitudes, as well as to blatant ethnic prejudice<ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-41368-001</ref>.
- **Moral Foundations -** Liberals tend to express compassion toward less structured and more encompassing entities, supporting universalism, while conservatives express compassion toward more well-defined and less encompassing entities, supporting parochialism<ref>https://files.catbox.moe/kafw6v.pdf</ref>. In other words, liberals tend to support an expansion of the moral circle. Higher perceptions of social dangers and greater emphases on the binding moral foundations relative to the individualizing foundations is associated with conservatism<ref>http://timbates.wdfiles.com/local--files/group-project/Leuwen%20and%20Park.pdf</ref>. Liberals have greater endorsement of the harm/care and fairness/reciprocity foundations compared to the other 3 foundations, while conservatives endorse and use the 5 foundations more equally<ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2009-05192-002</ref>.

**Lifestyle Correlates:**

- **Well-Being -** Conservatives tend to be happier<ref>https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1260817</ref>, have more meaning in life<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1948550618768241</ref>, have better mental health<ref>https://news.gallup.com/poll/102943/republicans-report-much-better-mental-health-than-others.aspx</ref><ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339541044_Mental_illness_and_the_left</ref>, and are physically healthier<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2912481/</ref><ref>http://sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886919300054</ref>. These effects are due to a number of causes, most notably a belief in personal agency being a cause of the happiness and health effects<ref>https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrp.2011.12.009</ref>. Interestingly, while conservatives tend to have better mental health than liberals, suicide rates tend to be higher in places that are more conservative or are run by more conservative governments<ref>https://jech.bmj.com/content/56/10/722</ref><ref>https://www.bmj.com/content/377/bmj-2021-069308</ref>.
- **Sexuality -** Those who engage in more traditional sexual behaviors tend to be more socially conservative, while those who engage in more masturbation, risky sex, and casual sex, tend to be more liberal. Despite the narrower band of activities that conservatives engage in, those with more conservative orientations tend to be more satisfied with their sex life<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886916310364</ref>. Conservatives are those who are most likely to spend money on pornography, likely because such desires are repressed within conservatives<ref>https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-human-beast/200903/why-conservatives-spend-more-pornography</ref>.
- **Fertility -** Conservatives generally have more kids and have them earlier, as well as being more likely to be married. These gaps have gotten larger over time<ref>https://ifstudies.org/blog/the-conservative-fertility-advantage</ref>. One potential factor playing into this is that after women have children, they tend to adopt more conservative social attitudes around gender roles<ref>https://www.nber.org/papers/w24740</ref>.
- **Alcoholism -** States that become more politically liberal tend to have increases in their demand for alcohol, with consumption of beer and spirits rising and consumption of wine potentially falling<ref>https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-wine-economics/article/abs/alcohol-consumption-and-political-ideology-whats-party-got-to-do-with-it/D7191B2F1C4F11D9527AFA6F06614912</ref>.
- **Charitability -** Conservatives are significantly more charitable than liberals<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0049089X21000752</ref>. Liberals self-report more criminal conduct than do conservatives<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886916310996?via%3Dihub</ref>. Political and religious conservatism are both inversely related to child abuse rates, although only the religious conservatism effect remained after controlling for population density<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0145213414004074</ref>.

**Demographic Correlates:**

- **Age -** Older Americans tend to be more conservative<ref>https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/07/09/the-politics-of-american-generations-how-age-affects-attitudes-and-voting-behavior/</ref>, and this is due to the effect of ageing increasing one's likelihood of being conservative<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0261379413000875</ref>.
- **Physical Appearance -** Right-wingers tend to be more attractive than left-wingers<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpubeco.2016.12.008</ref><ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1017/pls.2017.18</ref>, partially due to attractive people being more likely to support inequality<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2014.03.002</ref>, as they earn more. Appearance is a substantial predictor of political ideology, as facial recognition technology can correctly identify political orientation in liberal-conservative face pairs significantly greater than at random<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7801376/</ref>.

### Behaviors/Thought Patterns

- **Activism -** Consistent liberals and consistent conservatives are the people most likely to engage in activism and the political process<ref>https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2014/06/12/section-5-political-engagement-and-activism/</ref>. Stereotypes and perceptions about activists reduce people's willingness to affiliate with activists and to adopt the behaviors these activists promote<ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2013-42785-004</ref>.
- **Genetic Attributions -** Genetic attributions are more likely to be made by liberals, are associated with higher and not lower levels of tolerance of vulnerable individuals, and are unrelated with unseemly racial attitudes<ref>https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/696860</ref>. Both conservative economic and social political ideology indirectly predict homophobia through binding foundations<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28466228/#:~:text=Study%202%20found%20that%20both,between%20political%20ideology%20and%20homophobia</ref>.
- **Authoritarianism -** Right-wing authoritarianism and left-wing authoritarianism are separate constructs that reflect a shared constellation of personality traits, cognitive features, beliefs, and motivational values that are at the core of authoritarianism in general. Relative to right-wing authoriarians, left-wing authoritarians have more negative emotionality, are lower in dogmatism and cognitive rigidity, and express stronger support for state control. Left-wing authoritarianism is a strong predictor of behavioral aggression and participation in political violence<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34383522/</ref>.
- **Discrimination -** Compared to conservatives, moderates and liberals are much less accepting of discriminatory actions. Conservatives tend to value employers' decision rights while others value utilitarian concerns<ref>https://www.nber.org/papers/w30236#fromrss</ref>.
- **Interracial Interactions -** White liberals but not white conservatives present less competence to black interaction partners than white ones, suggesting that well-intentioned liberal whites may draw on low-status/competence stereotypes to affiliate with minorities<ref>https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/pv2ab</ref>.

## Knowledge Retention

Across a variety of fields, students lose a large percentage of the knowledge they receive in a course within the first two years following completion<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.2307/1182376</ref><ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1177/0273475306291463</ref><ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6920-6-5</ref><ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1007/s10459-008-9101-y</ref>.

## Autism

Interesting factoids about autism:

* Autistic people have particular morphological features which can strongly predict someone having autism<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21999758/</ref><ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20473590/</ref><ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22669539/</ref>.
* Premature mortality is markedly increased in ASD owing to a multitude of medical conditions<ref>https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/premature-mortality-in-autism-spectrum-disorder/4C9260DB64DFC29AF945D32D1C15E8F2</ref>.
* Neurotypical peers are less willing to interact with autistic people based on thin slice judgments. These do not change with increased exposure and occur across both children and adults<ref>https://www.nature.com/articles/srep40700#discussion</ref>. However, these biases disappear when impressions are based on conversational content lacking audio-visual cues. This suggests that style and not substance drives negative impressions of autistic people.
* Children with autism have significantly higher levels of suicidal ideation and higher rates of suicide attempts<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1750946712000931</ref>.
* Autism is highly heritable<ref>https://www.nature.com/articles/4001896</ref>.
* People with autism display facial expressions less frequently, for a less amount of time, and are less likely to share facial expressions with others or mimic expressions. Their facial expressions are also lower in quality and less accurately judged. However, people with ASD do not express emotions less intensely nor is their reaction time slower in response to stimuli<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/aur.2037</ref>.
* People with ASD, primarily males, have more hypersexual and paraphilic fantasies<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5789215/</ref>.
* Individuals with ASD are less able to understand and infer other people's beliefs, intentions, and feelings, less likely to respond to the specific emotions of people in pain, less cognitively aware of the belief in, intention of and feeling for others, and have less immediate response to the special emotions of people in pain. People with ASD are as likely to immediately share and resonate with the emotions of other people, and are more likely to share or become affectively congruent with others' emotional states<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6794557/</ref>.

## Heritability

Heritability is a very misleading concept for several reasons. It is often assumed to be the amount of a trait that is due to genetics, but there is no measure of this. There are several limitations to the notion of heritability<ref>https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcs.1400</ref>:

* First, heritability looks at the proportion of population variance in a trait that can be explained by population differences in genetics. This means that heritability estimates can be very different for the same trait depending on the population examined. For example, in the case of a population with very little environmental variation, you will have a significantly higher heritability estimate for a trait compared with a population with very high environmental variation.
* Second, given that all traits are filtered through genetics, it is impossible to actually separate out genetic from environmental effects. Genes turn on and respond in various ways depending on the environment, so the strict separation between genetic and environmental influences is highly dubious.
* Third, twin studies which are the hallmark of heritability estimates assume that identical twins have no more similar environments than fraternal twins, and thus attribute all differences between groups to genetics. However, identical twins are exposed to demonstrably similar environments than are fraternal twins, starting in the womb. Identical twins often share a placenta while fraternal twins always have two separate placentas. Identical twins that share a placenta have more similar IQs and personalities than identical twins who do not share a placenta. This effect however appears to be small and only limited to a few phenotypes<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1007/s10519-015-9745-3</ref>. More significantly, it is likely that identical twins will be treated in social interactions more similarly than fraternal twins, increasing the similarity of their environments further. This has been shown to undermine research finding a strong heritability for schizophrenia, as identical twins have a smaller differences in their level of bullying, sexual abuse, physical maltreatment, emotional neglect and abuse, and general trauma compared to fraternal twins<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25972816/</ref>. Only some of those traits could be reasonably suggested to be genetic. This is consistent with research suggesting that the equal environments assumption is not strictly valid for most outcomes, with a likely modest bias<ref>https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/10.1080/19485565.1968.9987750</ref><ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2013.10.004</ref>.

## Personality

Neuroticism is the strongest predictor of life satisfaction, happiness, and negative affect. Positive affect is predicted equally well by extraversion and agreeableness<ref>https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.124.2.197</ref>.

Academic performance correlates significantly with agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness. Correlations between conscientiousness and academic performance were largely independent of intelligence. Conscientiousness is as strong of a predictor of tertiary academic performance as intelligence, after controlling for secondary academic performance<ref>https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1037/a0014996</ref>.

## Religious Belief

### Religiosity and Suicide

Religion overall plays a protective role in preventing suicide<ref>https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/155/5/413/171404</ref><ref>https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0131715</ref>. This can be seen in terms of both suicide attempts and completed suicides, although religion does not reduce suicidal ideation<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7310534/#:~:text=Several%20studies%20have%20found%20lower,after%20adjusting%20for%20social%20support</ref>. This may be due to religion providing access to a supportive community, shaping a person’s beliefs about suicide, providing a source of hope and providing ways to interpret suffering.

### Religiosity and Mental Health

Religiousity and spirituality is associated with better mental health<ref>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508619.2020.1729570</ref>, lower depressive symptoms and less anxiety<ref>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2022.877213/full</ref>, as well as increased life satisfaction<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/364086091_A_Meta-Analysis_of_ReligionSpirituality_and_Life_Satisfaction</ref>.

### Religiosity and Sense of Purpose

Conservative religiousity is associated with high levels of a sense of purpose in life<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/009164718601400105</ref>. For socially connected individuals, a religious belief in itself has minimal impact on their sense of purpose in life. However, for those who are socially disconnected, being highly religious predicted greater levels of purpose in life<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jopy.12401</ref>. Because though religion brings people social connection in many cases, controlling for it may only tell the effect of theistic belief in sense of purpose and not the broader effect of religiousity in general. A sense of meaning in life is a crucial element of religious coping and psychological well-being<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4580713/</ref>.

### Religiosity and Crime

Religion is negatively associated with crime on both an individual level<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022427801038001001#:~:text=The%20results%20of%20the%20meta,effect%20on%20individuals'%20criminal%20behavior</ref> and a societal level<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0191886996000232</ref>, as well as being negatively associated with involvement in delinquent behaviors<ref>https://scholarlycommons.obu.edu/articles/131/</ref>.

## Self Control

Low self-control in childhood is associated with unemployment in adulthood, even after adjusting for intelligence, social class, and gender<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797615569001</ref>. It is also associated with lower social responsibility<ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1962-04824-001</ref>, more disciplinary referrals<ref>https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/pubeco/v95y2011i11p1377-1385.html</ref>, in addition to differences in physical health, substance dependence, personal finances, and criminal offending outcomes<ref>https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1010076108</ref>. Assignment to different schooling opportunities is not significantly associated with child time preferences<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004727271930091X</ref>.

## Suicide

Suicide is mainly associated with social isolation, such as marital status and living alone, loneliness, alienation, and belongingness<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30445391/</ref>. In terms of cross-country differences in suicide, high unemployment is positviely associated with male suicide, while income is negatively associated with male suicide up until a high threshold of income<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1069397103253708</ref>.

Suicidal acts are significantly more likely to be fatal for men than for women<ref>https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M19-1324</ref>.

Between 1963 and 1975 the annual number of suicides in England and Wales showed a sudden and unexpected decline, inconsistent with trends in most other European countries. This appears to have been a result of the progressive removal of carbon monoxide from the public gas supply, which accounted for more than 40% of suicides in 1963. Suicide by domesic gas was essentially eliminated by 1975<ref>https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/449144</ref>.

## Tattoos

People with tattoos tend to be rated as less attractive, more promiscuous, and more heavy drinkers based on their appearance<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18089280/</ref>. While some stereotyping may be negative in this respect, there is a degree of accuracy to negative stereotypes about tattooed people.

People with tattoos are more likely to engage in risk-taking behaviors<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22153289/</ref>, including physical violence<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12042538/</ref>, more drinking and illicit drug consumption, higher suicidal ideation/attempts and depression<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22726901/</ref>, psychiatric disorders such as antisocial personality disorder and borderline personality disorder<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2333825/</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/07/080715204734.htm</ref>, higher levels of psychopathy and schizophrenia<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1781185/</ref>, higher impulsiveness, adventurism, empathy, and neuroticism<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15119003/</ref>, and have an earlier age of first intercourse and are more sexually active<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22616886/</ref>.

Moreover, people with tattoos are more likely to have experienced childhood abuse and neglect<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35449026/</ref>, and score about 5 points lower on IQ tests<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15119003/</ref>. They also appear to die earlier than those without tattoos, possibly due to health concerns but also potentially due to higher levels of risk-taking behavior<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24926092/</ref>.

Tattoos may signify something traumatic or extreme in someone's life or may signify impulsiveness in itself.

## Trigger Warnings

Trigger warnings have no net effect on affective responses to material being warned about nor on educational outcomes<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7993791/</ref><ref>https://osf.io/qav9m/</ref>. It doesn't decrease engagement with negative material but can in fact increase engagement with material. Additionally, trigger warnings reinforce trauma survivor’s views of their trauma being central to their identity and increase anticipatory stress<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2167702620921341</ref>. This suggests that trigger warnings at best do essentially nothing and at worst have small negative effects.

## Physiognomy

Facial width-to-height ratio is a predictor of one's propensity for aggressive behavior<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2570531/</ref>.

Female politicians with stereotypically feminine facial features are more likely to be republican<ref>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/09/120927130955.htm</ref>.

The facts of politicians judged to be supporters of the Conservative Party are rated as more intelligent, attractive, honest, and of higher social class than the facts of politicians judged to be from the Labor Party. This effect exists regardless of the political allegiances of the observers<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/3791063?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents</ref>.

Taller individuals are more likely to support the Conservative Party, support conservative policies and vote Conservative<ref>https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-political-science/article/height-income-and-voting/2B6875BFB8B956963D1DBBD510A581CF</ref>.

Self-perceived attractiveness is associated with support for group-based dominance and belief in legitimizing ideologies. This effect is mediated by subjective social class. Lower self-perceived attractiveness decreases subjective SES, which leads to a greater tendency to reject social hierarchies and to construe inequality in terms of contextual causes<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749597814000223?via%3Dihub</ref>.

Individuals vulnerable to depression are less likely to identify with mainstream conservative parties, to vote for them, or to place themselves on the political right<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1354068820930391</ref>.

## Eugenics/Genetic Enhancement

Anomaly (2018) defended the concept of eugenics or genetic enhancement and advocated for numerous "eugenic" policy proposals. Policy proposals include free contraception, genetic education and counseling, and incentives and penalties<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40592-018-0081-2</ref>. Jonathan Anomaly believes that states should apply as little coercion as possible to facilitate the emergence of future people with desirable traits.

## MAOA Gene

The 2-repeat allele of the MAOA gene is carried by 0.1% of caucasian males and 5.2% of African-American males. African-American males who carried the 2-repeat allele are significantly more likely to be arrested and incarcerated, are more anti-social, and have higher involvement in violent behaviors over the life course<ref>https://lesacreduprintemps19.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/exploring-the-association-between-the-2-repeat-allele-of-the-maoa-gene.pdf</ref>. A similar analysis could not be done for caucasians due to its rarity amongst caucasians.

## Altruism and Ethics

Humans routinely help others to achieve their goals, even when the helper receives no immediate benefit and the person helped is a stranger. Such altruistic behaviors exist in human children as young as 18 months in age and also exist in chimpanzees although with less robust skills and motivations<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16513986/</ref>.

## Biorealism

Across a large number of traits analyzed, there was a mean 49% heritability of the traits among populations<ref>https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3285</ref>.

Contrary to expert opinion based on polling, delay of gratification times have been increasing over the past 50 years, with a fifth of a standard increase in ability per decade<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2020.101451</ref>.

Individuals carrying the S allele of the serotonin transporter functional polymorphism 5-HTTLPR produce significantly less 5-HTT mRNA and protein, which results in higher concentrations of serotonin in the synaptic cleft relative to individuals carrying the L allele. Evidence suggests that individuals carrying the S allele tend to have higher negative emotion. There is evidence that collectivistic cultures are significantly more likely to comprise individuals carrying the S allele of the 5-HTTLPR<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2842692/</ref>.

Whites tend to have lower job status and income when the level of general intelligence is taken into account<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229357056_Occupation_and_income_related_to_psychometric_g</ref>.

Self control has a 60% heritability<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763418307905</ref>.

Parental incarceration generally has positive effects on the child through the removal of a negative role model<ref>https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3034539</ref><ref>https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20190415&from=f</ref>.

There exists genetic influences which explain the overlap between low IQ and antisocial behavior in young children<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2254220/</ref>.

Frisell et al. (2012) found varying estimates for the heritability of violent crime, with models producing a range from 20-55%<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10519-011-9483-0</ref>.

Black children tend to have less delay of gratification than white children<ref>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224545.1974.9923126</ref><ref>https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/pubeco/v95y2011i11p1377-1385.html</ref>. A one standard deviation increase in the discount rate is associated with an increase in the number of disciplinary referrals a child has the following school year by 14%.

## Biology of Economics

Savings propensities are about 33% heritable, and individuals are born with a persistent genetic predisposition to a specific savings behavior. Parenting has some effect on savings among younger individuals but this effect decays over time<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/679284#metadata_info_tab_contents</ref>.

Lifetime income is 24% heritable in women and 54% heritable in men<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2253264</ref>.

## Belief

Although there has been previous research suggesting that correcting misinformation may backfire, causing people to strengthen false misconceptions rather than reduce them, more recent research suggests that by and large citizens heed factual information, even when such information challenges their ideological commitments<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-018-9443-y</ref><ref>https://skepticalscience.com/docs/DebunkingHandbook2020.pdf</ref>.

Although many people may have the impression that people with conspiracy beliefs are very irrational and thus won't budge to new evidence, they in fact can. Research shows that belief in conspiracy theories can be reduced through rational argumentation<ref>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01525/full</ref>. This is in spite of the fact that many people who believe in conspiracy theories are motivated to do so, due to many people holding conspiracy theories having a need to uniqueness<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/314188232_Too_special_to_be_duped_Need_for_uniqueness_motivates_conspiracy_beliefs</ref>.

A 2004 meta-analysis found that there is a sleeper effect, where a discounting piece of evidence is less persuasive immediately after exposure than it is later in time. The increase in persuasion is stronger when recipients of discounting cues have higher ability or motivation to think about the message<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3100161/</ref>.

Confirmation bias is the tendency to seek or interpret evidence in ways that are partial to existing beliefs, expectations, or a hypothesis in hand<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1037/1089-2680.2.2.175</ref>. This has been shown in the case of the evaluation of political arguments, where attitudinally congruent arguments are uncritically supported and evaluated as stronger than attitudinally incongruent arguments, which are counter-argued against<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00214.x</ref>. The latter can be referred to as a disconfirmation bias. This can lead to attitude polarization. Whether a person's prior belief is accompanied by emotional conviction affects the magnitude and form of the disconfirmation bias<ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1996-01782-001</ref>.

## Religion

There is a negative relationship between intelligence and religiosity. Possible reasons include that intelligent people are less likely to conform, that intelligent people tend to adopt an analytic rather than intuitive thinking, and that several functions such as compensatory control, self-regulation, self-enhancement, and secure attachment, are also conferred by intelligence<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1088868313497266</ref>.

Most human rights practices are worse in societies where citizens are more religious and that muslim majority nations provide less respect for almost all human rights<ref>https://muse.jhu.edu/article/730069/pdfimage</ref>.

Scientists are significantly less likely to believe in the existence of a god compared to the general public<ref>https://www.pewforum.org/2009/11/05/scientists-and-belief/</ref>.

## Journalists

Journalists generally prefer parties with more left-wing positions<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353756955_The_Left-liberal_Skew_of_Western_Media</ref>.

## Weight Loss

Obesity is associated with higher all-cause mortality<ref>https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/1555137</ref>.

Obesity has a substantial heritability, although there is significant variability in the heritability estimate across studies<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3355836/</ref>.

Reduced energy diets and weight loss medications result in some weight loss outcomes, while advice-only and exercise-alone had minimal effects<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17904936/</ref>.

## Misc

Delay gratification times have been increasing over the past 50 years, corresponding to secular gains in IQ seen, suggesting a possible common cause<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289620300295</ref>.

Richardson (2017) argues that GWAS correlations with cognitive measures between populations are inevitable and meaningless<ref>https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/embr.201744140</ref>. First, there is already some cryptic but functionally irrelevant genetic stratification which can covary adventitiously with cognitive variation and social class. Second, the dependent variables of cognitive and educational ability reflect prior social stratification.
