## Public Opinion and Political Change

The impact of public opinion on public policy is substantial, and salience of issues enhances the impact. This impact remains strong even when the activities of political organizations and elites are taken into account<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/3219881#metadata_info_tab_contents</ref><ref>https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/abs/effects-of-public-opinion-on-policy/856B172A7DC19A7EB72C569A7F6F2104</ref>. Policy also drives public opinion, as the public naturally responds positively or negatively to policy changes by the government<ref>https://oxfordre.com/politics/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228637-e-74</ref>.

## Stability

Democracies are less warlike than other regimes, particularly in terms of the severity of war<ref>https://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/DP95.HTM</ref>.

Polities with higher levels of democracy are more likely to be politically stable<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/intesociscierevi.90.1.01</ref>.

## Economic Growth

There is very clearly a positive correlation between democracy and economic growth. However, there is a lot of debate about the causal direction, if there is a causal relationship at all<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00299.x</ref><ref>https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/700936</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1048984317308093</ref><ref>https://0x0.la/u/fcovCUN.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.columbia.edu/~flr9/documents/Rivera-Batiz_Democracy_Governance_Growth.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2014/05/democracy-boost-economic-growth/</ref><ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-5907.00023</ref><ref>https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-political-science/article/democracy-political-stability-and-economic-growth/1630FBD0E7690CAF595EE9C612E405AE</ref><ref>https://www.democracy.uci.edu/files/docs/conferences/grad/chen.pdf</ref><ref>https://scholar.harvard.edu/jrobinson/files/jr_econdevelopment.pdf</ref>. I would need to examine this question further to form a stronger opinion on it, although a lot of the mechanisms discussed below in studies for how democracy causes economic growth seem intuitively correct to me. It is clear that while the precise economic effects of democracy have not been determined, it is very unlikely that democracy has negative effects on economic growth. In order to even begin to establish such a relationship, it would first need to be shown that there was a negative correlation between democracy and economic growth, and the existing evidence suggests the exact reverse.
