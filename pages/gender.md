## Understanding Sex Differences

While it is fair to suggest that gender is distinct from sex, the two concepts are nonetheless inextricably linked. In spite of the narrativizing which suggests that men and women are the same from the neck up, the reality is that men and women are fundamentally different from one another.

A common talking point meant to undermine the notion of sexes being distinct is to argue that sexes aren't binary but bimodal. The rationale for this is that phenotypic traits between men and women exist on a spectrum, thus allowing for a bimodal distribution of traits upon which men and women operate in sexually dimorphic ways. Furthermore, there is a small but substantial percentage of the population who have disorders of sex development, in which they may display traits that would be regarded by some as intersex. While some estimate the number of intersex people to be as high as 1.7%, Sax (2002) argues that to have any meaning, intersex should be restricted to those conditions where chromosomal sex is inconsistent with phenotypic sex, or in which the phenotype is not classifiable as either male or female. Under this definition, the true prevalence is actually about 0.018%<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12476264/</ref>. Any real definition of sex effectively makes sex binary, with some extremely rare exceptions.

### Physical

Physical sex differences are certainly the most obvious of sex differences. Physical sex differences are small but noticeable at birth, and increase significantly during puberty due to differences in testosterone<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1521690X07000371?via%3Dihub</ref><ref>https://journals.lww.com/co-endocrinology/Abstract/2009/02000/Effect_of_puberty_on_body_composition.4.aspx</ref>. Sex differences for muscle power are significant even when height, weight, and age are controlled for<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2466/pms.110.3.714-720</ref> and athletic differences are so large that top level high school boys are better in athletics than top level olympic women in a variety of areas<ref>https://boysvswomen.com/#/</ref>. Men have 61% more muscle mass<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1090513809000397?via%3Dihub</ref>, and lower fat mass and higher mineral mass after adjusting for height<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1521690X07000371?via%3Dihub</ref>.

Some may attribute these differences to socialization. From any intuitive perspective this view appears absurd, especially when taking into account sex differences in hormones and bone structure which are almost entirely a product of genetics as opposed to environment. Not only are these differences obviously biological, but evidence indicates that these physical differences were sexually selected for over time. Fat free mass and limb muscle volume in men are significant predictors of the numbers of total and past-year self-reported sex partners, as well as age at first intercourse, suggesting that sexual selection may have contributed to these physical sex differences<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1090513809000397?via%3Dihub</ref>. Sexual selection creates sexual dimorphism.

### Psychological

The vast majority of people are fine with acknowledging the existence of physical sex differences. It seems strange to suggest that sexual selection and sexual dimorphism stopped at the neck, but many are uncomfortable with acknowledging that men and women are different temperamentally.

Krizan & Teeter (2015) used meta-synthesis to examine gender similarities and differences, and found that the average absolute difference between men and women across domains was relatively small, with the distributions of men and women on most variables overlapping by about 84%<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zlatan-Krizan/publication/271722875_Evaluating_Gender_Similarities_and_Differences_Using_Metasynthesis/links/55c35cdf08aea2d9bdc06e70/Evaluating-Gender-Similarities-and-Differences-Using-Metasynthesis.pdf</ref>. Sex differences in psychological traits including personality, sexuality, attitudes, emotions, behaviors, and cognitive abilities, are larger in cultures with more egalitarian sex role socialization and greater sociopolitical gender equity<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289724723_The_Evolution_of_Culturally-Variable_Sex_Differences_Men_and_Women_Are_Not_Always_Different_but_When_They_AreIt_Appears_Not_to_Result_from_Patriarchy_or_Sex_Role_Socialization</ref>. Even sex differences in physical traits such as height, obesity, and blood pressure are exacerbated in such cultures. Psychological sex differences have substantial overlap, but nonetheless consistently exist across cultures, and become stronger in more egalitarian cultures where sex differences would naturally be allowed to flourish. Socialization cannot be a major contributor to these differences, because across cultures with vastly different socialization patterns these sex differences persist. There are a significant number of pieces of evidence beyond this which suggest that psychological sex differences are biological:

*Reiner & Gearhart (2014) looked at 16 genetic males with cloacal exstrophy, an extremely rare birth defect that is associated with severe phallic inadequacy or phallic absence. As a result, 14 of the 16 males were neonatally assigned female socially, legally, and surgically. They tracked all of the children from ages 5 to 16 and found that 8 of the 14 subjects assigned to the female sex declared themselves male during the course of the study. Moreover, all 16 subjects had moderate to marked interests and attitudes that were considered typical of males<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1421517/</ref>. Additionally, The John Money experiment<ref>https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/david-reimer-and-john-money-gender-reassignment-controversy-johnjoan-case</ref> was a very famous experiment which examined the degree to which gender identity is intractable. To simplify, David and Brian Reimer were identical twins. After David suffered from a botched circumcision, he was raised as a girl while Brian was raised as a boy. David received estrogen during adolescence to help the development of feminine characteristics. In spite of the socialization David received, he experienced intense gender dysphoria as a child and desired to become a male. These two studies are consistent with the idea that a person's gender identity generally corresponds to a person's biological sex. Psychological sex differences correspond to biological sex even with attempts to socialize individuals out of it.
*Boys and girls aged 9-17 months old, an age when they show few signs if any of recognizing their sex or the sex of others, still have marked differences in preference for stereotypically male vs stereotypically female toys. These sex differences in toy preferences also occur with rhesus monkeys<ref>https://stanmed.stanford.edu/how-mens-and-womens-brains-are-different/</ref>. Girls exposed to high levels of androgen in the prenatal and early postnatal periods show increased play with boys' toys and reduced play with girls' toys suggesting hormones may play a role in this sex difference<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9280.1992.tb00028.x</ref>. Psychological sex differences occur before gendered socialization can meaningfully influence behavior and are mediated by hormones, which naturally differ between men and women.

Differential sexual selective pressures for men and women can help to explain how psychological sex differences may emerge<ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1995-21138-001</ref>. Men can only be certain about whether they have in fact reproduced if they have a woman who is sexually loyal, while women can be guaranteed following sexual intercourse that they have reproduced. Through this mechanism, men and women will naturally develop different preferences in terms of their mate's personalities as well as different tendencies, personalities, etc. Janicke et al. (2016) finds that across the animal kingdom, sexual selection is stronger in males than in females and is evolutionarily tied to sex biases in parental care and sexual dimorphism. In the animal kingdom, females typically exhibit greater parental investment which leads to them becoming a limiting resource, such that males compete for females and not the other way around<ref>https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1500983</ref>.

While all of this evidence together clearly shows that men and women are naturally different psychologically, specifics have not been discussed. These specifics are essential for understanding why men and women will naturally have different interests and outcomes within society.

#### Brain Differences

Psychological sex differences naturally manifest themselves in the brain. Men and women have different brain structures which can help to explain the myriad differences between men and women.

Neural networks utilizing neuroimaging can successfully differentiate between a male brain and a female brain with 93.3% accuracy<ref>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00185/full</ref>. There is immense overlap between the brains of men and women however<ref>https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1509654112</ref>. There are a very wide number of documented sex differences which exist in the brain, many of which are tied to functions which may explain differences between men and women in certain tasks, with men excelling and some and women excelling at others. Moreover, models have been developed which can predict a person's sex based on certain pieces of information about the brain such as MRI scans or electroencephalogram data with up to 96% accuracy, suggesting that these differences are not trivial<ref>https://archive.org/details/pdfy-VLw_XW3rMqu7yygj/mode/1up</ref><ref>https://www.psypost.org/2017/08/study-15847-people-worldwide-uncovers-sex-differences-asymmetry-major-brain-structures-49459</ref><ref>https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2013/december/brain-connectivity-study-revea</ref><ref>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21495-7</ref><ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29322586/</ref><ref>https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1523888113</ref><ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29414494/</ref><ref>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00029/full</ref>.

#### Aggression and Motor Control

Likely the least controversial of sex differences to talk about concern aggression and motor control. These reflect themselves in the fact that men tend to be larger and have different physiologies compared to women, so even social constructionist extremists are likely more willing to accept these differences.

Men in general are more aggressive than women, especially in terms of physical aggression. However, the difference becomes less clear when discussing more social forms of aggression. The overall difference in aggression can at least in part be explained by differences between men and women in testosterone, which has been found to predict aggression<ref>https://archive.org/details/pdfy-VLw_XW3rMqu7yygj/mode/1up</ref><ref>https://www.academia.edu/22213818/The_relationship_between_testosterone_and_aggression_a_meta-analysis</ref><ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257525063_Testosterone_and_aggression_A_reanalysis_of_Book_Starzyk_and_Quinsey%27s_2001_study</ref><ref>https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323085</ref><ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1987-10140-001</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1359178914000329?via%3Dihub</ref><ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12147-008-9065-5</ref>.

Men and women appear to have differences in terms of motor control. While overall, there is no clear sex difference, women perform better on fine motor skills, while men perform better on targeting and throwing accuracy. This latter finding exists at an early age, suggesting it has at least a partial biological origin<ref>https://archive.org/details/pdfy-VLw_XW3rMqu7yygj/mode/1up</ref><ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261570835_Gender_Differences_in_Children%27s_Throwing_Performance_Biology_and_Environment</ref>.

There is some speculation that the male advantage in throwing might be caused by better spatial abilities in men, although empirical evidence on this appears to be mixed as far as I can tell. I'm agnostic on this hypothesis at the moment<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01065771</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/019188699190053E?via%3Dihub</ref>.

Women outperform men in fine motor coordination and perceptual speed<ref>https://stanmed.stanford.edu/how-mens-and-womens-brains-are-different/</ref>.

#### Intelligence

Male and female children tend to have roughly similar overall intelligence with each sex outperforming the other in certain forms of intelligence<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10648-022-09705-1</ref>. Women have a very small advantage in verbal ability<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232528001_Gender_Differences_in_Verbal_Ability_A_Meta-Analysis</ref>. They have better reading comprehension and writing ability<ref>https://stanmed.stanford.edu/how-mens-and-womens-brains-are-different/</ref>. Men have an advantage in visuo-spatial abilities<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.117.2.250</ref><ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-010-0042-0</ref><ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.3758/s13423-016-1085-7</ref><ref>https://tdlc.ucsd.edu/global/images/Levine_et%20al_WIREs_Mental_Rotation_review.pdf</ref><ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-019-01633-6</ref>. Women have an advantage in verbal episodic-memory tasks but have a disadvantage in episodic-memory tasks requiring both verbal and visuospatial processing<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8721.2008.00547.x</ref>.

Men have significantly more gray matter in the brain, while women have significantly more white matter, suggesting that while there are essentially no disparities in general intelligence the ways in which that intelligence manifests itself is different<ref>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/01/050121100142.htm</ref>. There is greater male than female variability in regional brain structure across the lifespan, which suggests that men may have higher variability in their intelligence than women<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hbm.25204</ref>.

The differences between men and women in spatial and verbal intelligence, in addition to the difference in variability, have significant implications for disparities between men and women in society. The spatial-verbal divide can help explain some sex differences in occupations, and the higher male variability can help explain why men are overrepresented in fields that are extremely cognitively demanding.

#### Values

Men and women tend to have different values, consistent with sex stereotypes about women caring more about harm, fairness, and purity. Likewise, women also tend to be more egalitarian.

Luoto & Varella (2021) looked at the relationship between policy interventions conducted to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic and the sex of the politicians enacting the interventions<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8015803/#B80</ref>. They found that on average, female leaders seem more focused on minimizing direst human suffering caused by the virus, while male leaders implement riskier short-term decisions with the possible intent of minimizing economic disruptions. This is consistent with findings that women tend to have stronger empathy, higher pathogen disgust, health concern, care-taking orientation, and dislike for the suffering of other people. On the other hand, it is also consistent with findings that men tend to engage in higher-risk-taking, are more machiavellian, more psychopathic, and focus more on financial indicators of success and status.

Atari et al. (2020) found that women across cultures consistently score higher than men on care, fairness, and purity moral foundations, with no sex differences on loyalty and authority, which are negligible and highly variable across cultures<ref>https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2020.1201</ref>. These differences were larger in individualist and gender-equal societies with more flexible social norms. Consistent with this, Benenson et al. (2018) finds that women tend to be more egalitarian than men, a difference which emerges in early childhood<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/desc.12750</ref>.

#### Personality

Sex differences in personality also exist across cultures, and are consistent with sex stereotypes. Women tend to be more neurotic and agreeable compared to men. Personality traits display little overlap between men and women.

Research has overwhelmingly suggested that psychological sex differences exist in terms of personality (many papers use gender instead of sex, given that biological and sex converge upon one another 99% of the time, it's reasonable to treat these as synonymous for the purposes of our discussion). The most notable sex differences occur on the aggregate big five personality trait measures of neuroticism and agreeableness<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7809307/</ref><ref>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00178/full</ref>.

I'm fairly interested in investigating the degree to which these differences are a result of biology as opposed to socialization. I would first point out that such differences are extremely large, which means that any social force which 100% accounts for sex differences in personality must also be extremely large to push men and women into certain personality traits<ref>https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029265</ref>.

These differences do not vary significantly by age, and are more pronounced as cultures become more egalitarian. There are a wide variety of explanations for this precise finding, with a lot of research consistent or inconsistent with any given theory. However, if it is the case that there are at least some sex differences in personality across all cultures, and these are all in the same direction of men scoring higher or lower on a given measure in each culture, it seems fair to suggest that socializing factors cannot fully explain these differences in personality<ref>https://www.gwern.net/docs/psychology/personality/2018-kajonius.pdf</ref><ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11519935/</ref><ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30206941/</ref><ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18179326/</ref><ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337752795_Does_Gender_Equality_Cause_Gender_Differences_in_Values_Reassessing_the_Gender-Equality-Personality_Paradox</ref>.

Therefore, it appears reasonable to assert that there are sex differences in personality, and that these are partially but not entirely explained by biological differences between the sexes.

<span style="color:red">In terms of the magnitude of sex differences in personality, Giudice et al. (2012) found that on aggregate there is an overlap of only 10% between the male and female distributions, an extremely large difference by psychological standards. Falk & Hermle (2018) found that across countries, gender differences in preferences (which include willingness to take risks, patience, altruism, positive and negative reciprocity, and trust) are positively related to economic development and gender equality.
Women are generally seen as being more nurturing and empathetic compared to men. Nonhuman animals as well as human infants and children have all been observed to have these sex differences in empathy, suggesting that these differences have evolutionary origins. This is also corroborated by examinations of the brains of men and women, who differ in the basic networks involved in affective and cognitive forms of empathy (Christov-Moore et al., 2014).

<span style="color:red">There exist gender differences in competitiveness which may in part serve to explain various socioeconomic gender gaps observed in society (Lackner, 2021). Girls tend to compete using strategies that avoid direct interference with other girl’s goals, minimize the risk of retaliation, disguise competition, and reduce the strength of other girls. They only compete overtly from a position of high status within the community. This enforces equality in the female community and socially excludes other girls (Benenson, 2013). Women also tend to spend more time engaging in gossip (Levin & Arluke, 1985).

<span style="color:red">Women tend to become more angry in response to transgressions by a same-sex peer, and report their anger dissipating less quickly relative to men. Women also report taking longer to reconcile. This suggests that women are less prepared than men to resolve a conflict with a same-sex peer (Benenson et al., 2014). Consistent with this, mutual dislikability of team members tends to not impede team behavior in all-male teams, but does so in mixed sex teams and all-female teams (Gerhards & Kosfeld, 2017).

<span style="color:red">Men tend to be funnier than women (Greengross et al., 2020).

#### Interests

Men prefer working with things and women prefer working with people. This gender difference is consistent across cultures and time, which suggests there is at least a partially biological cause for it<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20180831133832/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/47af/4a7e87267aba681fb6971590ec80effce0c3.pdf</ref><ref>https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1751-9004.2010.00320.x</ref>. Sex differences in people and things orientation are reflected in academic publishing, where women are more prevalent as the first authors of articles in more people-oriented fields compared to fields that are more things-oriented, which have a high proportion of male first authors<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339507855_Sex_differences_in_people_and_things_orientation_are_reflected_in_sex_differences_in_academic_publishing</ref>.

#### Mental Health

Women tend to have worse mental health than men, having higher levels of anxiety and depression than men<ref>https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2011/08/mental-illness</ref><ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5532074/</ref>. These differences are largely ubiquitous cross-culturally, although more gender equal countries have larger gender gaps on mental health outcomes<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352827321000173</ref>. Higher GDP per capita is also associated with worse average mental health and a larger gender gap in mental health. In spite of all of this, men have higher suicide rates<ref>https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/abs/sociodemographic-psychiatric-and-somatic-risk-factors-for-suicide-a-swedish-national-cohort-study/38C261DEB9A28F6D244169B517227414</ref>. While women attempt suicide more, men have higher levels of completed suicides<ref>https://www.govst.edu/suicide-prevention/</ref>.

#### Ingroup Preference

Women tend to have a stronger in-group bias than men do<ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.87.4.494</ref>. While men and women do not differ in number of friends or amount of time spent with friends, nor in the value placed on intimate friendships, there exist sex differences in the nature of interactions with friends. Women tend to emphasize emotional sharing and talking, while men emphasize activities and doing things together<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00287568</ref>.

### The Significance of Sex Differences

## Sex Differences in Attraction and Mating Patterns

## Sex and Gender in Society

Sex differences, both physical and psychological, are immutable. It is impossible to completely get rid of these differences, although they may be malleable to some degree. Sex differences in many of these domains will necessarily result in different outcomes between men and women on a wide variety of domains. At the same time, it is important to note that many of these differences between men and women have distributions which overlap considerably. Men may be on average taller and more physically capable than women, but some women are taller and more physically capable than some men. Similarly, some men have predispositions more common of women, and some women have predispositions more common of men.

Gender, which is the social structures we have in society to describe sex and prescribe roles, will naturally arise in any social context in which men and women are interacting with one another. People, interacting with both men and women, will inevitably notice that men and women tend to be different in a variety of attributes. Even without a prior knwoledge of gender, the development of understandings of the differences between men and women will arise organically, and social structures will begin to recognize that.

At the same time, gender conceptions in society are somewhat malleable, and they should be modified to suit the needs of people. Gender abolitionism can never work, as it is impossible to deny sex differences. However, strict gender roles aren't inevitable either. I suggest that we should be sex conscious, understanding and respect the fact that men and women on average have differences, while also not preventing women or men who have sex-atypical interests from engaging in them. I will examine various examples of "sex atypicality" in future sections which have gained a fair bit of controversy, namely homosexuality and transgenderism.

## Sex Atypicality: Homosexuality

Homosexuality is understood as same-sex attraction. A 2013 survey of US adults found that 96.6% identified as straight,1.6% identified as gay/lesbian, 0.7% identified as bisexual, with 1.1% either not knowing or not answering <ref>Sexual orientation and health among U.S. adults: national health interview survey, 2013. (2014, July 15). PubMed. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25025690/</ref>.

Sexual orientation has been consistently found to have a partial genetic component, with multiple converging lines of evidence supporting the claim:

- There appears to be neurological differences between homosexuals and heterosexuals of the same sex<ref>Safron, A., Sylva, D., Klimaj, V., Rosenthal, A. M., Li, M., Walter, M., & Bailey, J. M. (2017). Neural correlates of sexual orientation in heterosexual, bisexual, and homosexual men. Scientific Reports, 7(1). https://doi.org/10.1038/srep41314</ref><ref>Manzouri, A., & Savic, I. (2017). Cerebral sex dimorphism and sexual orientation. Human Brain Mapping, 39(3), 1175–1186. https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.23908</ref>.
- GWAS and GWLS research has shown that same-sex sexual behavior has a genetic basis<ref>Ganna, A., Verweij, K. J. H., Nivard, M. G., Maier, R., Wedow, R., Busch, A. S., Abdellaoui, A., Guo, S., Sathirapongsasuti, J. F., Lichtenstein, P., Lundström, S., Långström, N., Auton, A., Harris, K. M., Beecham, G. W., Martin, E. R., Sanders, A. R., Perry, J. R. B., Neale, B. M., & Zietsch, B. P. (2019). Large-scale GWAS reveals insights into the genetic architecture of same-sex sexual behavior. Science, 365(6456). https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aat7693</ref><ref>Ganna, A., Verweij, K. J. H., Nivard, M. G., Maier, R., Wedow, R., Busch, A. S., Abdellaoui, A., Guo, S., Sathirapongsasuti, J. F., Lichtenstein, P., Lundström, S., Långström, N., Auton, A., Harris, K. M., Beecham, G. W., Martin, E. R., Sanders, A. R., Perry, J. R. B., Neale, B. M., & Zietsch, B. P. (2019). Large-scale GWAS reveals insights into the genetic architecture of same-sex sexual behavior. Science, 365(6456). https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aat7693</ref>.
- Twin studies have also revealed that same-sex sexual behavior is partly genetic in origin<ref>Whitam, F. L., Diamond, M., & Martin, J. (1993). Homosexual orientation in twins: A report on 61 pairs and three triplet sets. Archives of Sexual Behavior, 22(3), 187–206. https://doi.org/10.1007/bf01541765</ref><ref>Alanko, K., Santtila, P., Harlaar, N., Witting, K., Varjonen, M., Jern, P., Johansson, A., Von Der Pahlen, B., & Sandnabba, N. K. (2009). Common genetic effects of gender atypical behavior in childhood and sexual orientation in adulthood: a study of Finnish twins. Archives of Sexual Behavior, 39(1), 81–92. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-008-9457-3</ref><ref>Långström, N., Rahman, Q., Carlström, E., & Lichtenstein, P. (2008).

All of these lines of research together suggest that homosexuality has a genetic component to it. Ironically, there is also some evidence that homophobia has a substantial genetic component to it<ref>Zapko-Willmes, A., & Kandler, C. (2017). Genetic Variance in Homophobia: Evidence from Self- and Peer Reports. Behavior Genetics, 48(1), 34–43. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10519-017-9884-9</ref>.

While this research suggests that sexual orientation is at the very least recalcitrant, this does not necessarily mean that it cannot be changed. However, most research suggests that attempts to change sexual orientation are generally fruitless. Conversion therapy has been found to be ineffective in altering sexual orientation without causing harm , being linked to depression, suicidality, anxiety, social isolation, and decreased capacity for intimacy<ref>The What We Know Project. (2021, August 18). What does the scholarly research say about whether conversion therapy can alter sexual orientation without causing harm? | What We Know. What We Know. https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-whether-conversion-therapy-can-alter-sexual-orientation-without-causing-harm/</ref><ref>Ryan, C., Toomey, R. B., Diaz, R. M., & Russell, S. T. (2018). Parent-Initiated Sexual Orientation Change Efforts with LGBT Adolescents: Implications for young adult mental health and adjustment. Journal of Homosexuality, 67(2), 159–173. https://doi.org/10.1080/00918369.2018.1538407</ref>. According to one large survey, 57% of transgender and non-binary youth who have underwent conversion therapy reported a suicide attempt in the last year, significantly more than that of the gender transgender and non-binary population in general<ref>The Trevor Project National Survey 2019. (n.d.). https://www.thetrevorproject.org/survey-2019/?section=Conversion-Therapy-Change-Attempts</ref>, suggesting that conversion therapy efforts are ineffective for LGBT people in general.

This does not mean that it can never work in changing homosexual thoughts and/or behavior, however. In fact, self-reporting amongst "dissatisfied homosexuals" reported that those who underwent conversion therapy had decreased in the frequency of homosexual thoughts and fantasies due to their therapy, as well as large improvements in psychological, interpersonal, and spiritual well-being<ref>Nicolosi, J., Byrd, A. D., & Potts, R. W. (2000). Retrospective Self-Reports of Changes in Homosexual Orientation: A consumer survey of conversion therapy clients. Psychological Reports, 86(3_suppl), 1071–1088. https://doi.org/10.2466/pr0.2000.86.3c.1071</ref>. Byrd & Nicolosi (2002) also concluded that after meta-analyzing the research on the efficacy of conversion therapy that there was weak evidence that suggested it may be possible to change a person's sexual orientation<ref>Byrd, A. D., & Nicolosi, J. (2002). A Meta-Analytic Review of Treatment of Homosexuality. Psychological Reports, 1139–1152. https://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/wp-content/uploads/A-meta-analytic-review-of-treatment-of-homosexuality.pdf</ref>. However, the APA concludes that ''"efforts to change sexual orientation are unlikely to be successful and involve some risk of harm, contrary to the claims of SOCE practitioners and advocates,"'' and that ''"the population that undergoes SOCE tends to have strongly conservative religious views that lead them to seek to change their sexual orientation"''<ref>Glassgold, J. M., Beckstead, L., Drescher, J., Greene, B., Miller, R. L., Worthington, R. L., & American Psychological Association. (2009). Appropriate therapeutic responses to sexual orientation. https://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/therapeutic-response.pdf</ref>. Given the selection bias with people who are conservative and anti-gay disproportionately trying to get conversion therapy, it would make sense that some of them would in fact report it working and being positive. But the fact that even amongst this sample most people end up with significant psychological harm suggests that this would be harmful especially for those who don't share conservative views. The result on dissatisfied homosexuals can be understood in this framework as a sample of people who would be susceptible to conversion therapy potentially working even if it doesn't work on the general gay population.

### Psychological Profile

Homosexuals appear to suffer at a higher risk of mental health issues, suicidality, sexual risk behaviors, along with other things. Part of this is likely due to the nature of homosexuality being non-normative, meaning by its very nature it will likely correlate with worse well-being. Part of this is also likely due to discrimination.

**Mental Health**

LGB people are at higher risk of mental disorder, suicidal ideation, substance misuse, suicide attempts, and deliberate self-harm than heterosexuals<ref>Russell, S. T., & Joyner, K. (2001). Adolescent sexual orientation and suicide risk: evidence from a national study. American Journal of Public Health, 91(8), 1276–1281. https://doi.org/10.2105/ajph.91.8.1276</ref><ref>Meyer, I. H.

Much of this is likely due to minority stress caused by stigma, prejudice, and discrimination<ref>Meyer, I. H. (2003). Prejudice, social stress, and mental health in lesbian, gay, and bisexual populations: Conceptual issues and research evidence. Psychological Bulletin, 129(5), 674–697. https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.129.5.674</ref>.

Disparities for LGBTQ and gender nonconforming adolescents. PEDIATRICS, 141(5). https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2017-3004</ref>. Higher levels of gender nonconformity are in fact associated with a greater likelihood of adversity. Having nonheterosexual identity, attraction, and behavior are all associated with substance use, with greater risk in women compared to men<ref>McCabe, S. E., Hughes, T. L., Bostwick, W., & Boyd, C.

Responses from providers of homeless youth services suggest that sexual and gender minority youth are overrepresented among those experiencing homelessness, face longer periods of homelessness, and encounter more mental and physical health issues<ref>Choi, S. K., Wilson, B. D., Shelton, J., & Gates, G. J. (2015, June 1). Serving Our Youth 2015: The Needs and Experiences of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Questioning Youth Experiencing Homelessness. https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1pd9886n</ref>. Castellanos (2017) found three distinct pathways in this occurring: some experienced homelessness after disruptions in state care systems, others due to extreme family conflict over their sexual orientation, and most became homeless through long-term family disintegration, where disclosure of homosexuality exacerbated existing conflict<ref>Castellanos, H. D. (2015). The role of institutional placement, family conflict, and homosexuality in homelessness pathways among Latino LGBT youth in New York City.

LGB men tend to have a disproportionately high number of sexual partners<ref>Jeffries, W. L. (2011). The number of recent sex partners among bisexual men in the United States.

More negative attitudes toward homosexuality are directly associated with a greater likelihood of unprotected anal sex over the following year. Moreover, lower self-esteem, more anxious symptoms, and childhood sexual abuse are indirectly related to more unprotected anal sex through more sexual partners, sexual encounters, and substance abuse symptoms<ref>Rosario, M., Schrimshaw, E. W., & Hunter, J. (2006). A model of sexual risk behaviors among young gay and bisexual men: longitudinal associations of mental health, substance abuse, sexual abuse, and the Coming-Out Process.

**Discrimination**

Research suggests that discrimination, harassment, and bullying in Canadian schools against LGBT youth is very prevalent<ref>Taylor, C., & Peter, T. (2011). Every class in every school: Final report on the first national climate survey on homophobia, biphobia, and transphobia in Canadian schools. https://winnspace.uwinnipeg.ca/handle/10680/1265</ref>. The same study found that students from schools with gay-straight alliances are much more likely to agree that their school communities are supportive of LGBTQ people, are much more likely to be open with some or all of their peers about their sexual orientation and/or gender identity, and are more likely to see their school climate as becoming less homophobic. Bullying experiences amongst LGB people are associated with posttraumatic stress in adulthood<ref>Rivers, I. (2004). Recollections of bullying at school and their long-term implications for lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals. https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Recollections-of-bullying-at-school-and-their-for-Rivers/30346e04ce285342e2ee3d26f57ed78194e9a08e</ref>.

Victimization has a significant indirect effect on the mental health of gay men<ref>Puckett, J. A., Newcomb, M. E., Garofalo, R., & Mustanski, B. (2016).

PloS One, 16(1), e0245268. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245268</ref>. LGB young adults at the highest risk of attempting suicide and having other health problems are in fact ones who reported a high level of rejection by their families as a result of their sexual orientation<ref>Ryan, C., Huebner, D., Díaz, R., & Sánchez, J. (2009). Family rejection as a predictor of negative health outcomes in white and Latino lesbian, gay, and bisexual young adults. https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Family-Rejection-as-a-Predictor-of-Negative-Health-Ryan-Huebner/5b95069f8ef001261169772174b8fc8f0c3ba8dc</ref><ref>Family acceptance of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youth protects against depression, substance abuse, suicide, study suggests.

A more supportive social environment was significantly associated with fewer suicide attempts for LGB youth, even after controlling for sociodemographic variables and other risk factors for suicide attempts<ref>Hatzenbuehler, M. L. (2011). The social environment and suicide attempts in lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth. Pediatrics, 127(5), 896–903. https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2010-3020</ref>.

Sears & Mallory (2014) reviewed the literature on sexual orientation and employment discrimination and found that there exists widespread and continuing employment discrimination against LGBT people, which affects them in terms of health, wages, job opportunities, productivity in the workplace, and job satisfaction<ref>Sears, B., & Mallory, C. (2014, October 1). Employment Discrimination against LGBT People: Existence and Impact. https://escholarship.org/uc/item/9qs0n354</ref>. Moreover, Klawitter (2014) used meta-regression analysis and found that sexual orientation even after controlling for measures of work intensity explains the difference between homosexual and heterosexual men in terms of earnings. For women, the evidence is less conclusive<ref>Klawitter, M. (2014). Meta‐Analysis of the effects of sexual orientation on earnings.

**Random funni fact -** Homophobes are the most likely to be homosexuals, and homophobia often stems from authoritarian parents<ref>Bryner, J., & LiveScience. (2024, February 20). Homophobes might be hidden homosexuals. Scientific American. https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/homophobes-might-be-hidden-homosexuals/</ref>.

**Coming out**

Coming out about one's sexual orientation is linked to lower anxiety, more positive affectivity, and higher self esteem, and also correlated with higher levels of social support<ref>Jordan, K. M., & Deluty, R. H. (1998). Coming out for lesbian women. Journal of Homosexuality, 35(2), 41–63. https://doi.org/10.1300/j082v35n02_03</ref>. However, social reactions mediated the relationship between identity development and self-disclosure. Concealing one's homosexual identity is linked to a significantly higher incidence of cancer and infectious diseases, at least among gay men<ref>Elevated physical health risk among gay men who conceal their homosexual identity. (n.d.). https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0278-6133.15.4.243</ref>.

**Child Abuse**

A common talking point in anti-gay circles is that homosexuals (particularly men) are more likely to molest children. It is important to recognize distinctions between different groups of people who could reasonably be considered "homosexual men". There are men who are attracted to mature members of the same sex, and there are men who are just attracted to the same sex in general. If we use the latter definition, homosexuals are more likely to engage in child molestation when compared to those who are just attracted to the opposite sex in general, as a disproportionate number of men who engage in child molestation do it to male children<ref>Freund, K., & Watson, R. J. (1992). The proportions of heterosexual and homosexual pedophiles among sex offenders against children: An exploratory study. Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy, 18(1), 34–43. https://doi.org/10.1080/00926239208404356</ref>. However, if we restrict our definition to the former, men who are attracted to mature members of the same sex, they are no more likely to molest children than men who are attracted to mature members of the opposite sex. Such groups display similar levels of sexual attraction to children, which is to say very little<ref>Freund, K., Watson, R., & Rienzo, D. (1989). Heterosexuality, homosexuality, and erotic age preference. The Journal of Sex Research, 26(1), 107–117. https://doi.org/10.1080/00224498909551494</ref><ref>Facts about homosexuality and child molestation. (n.d.). https://lgbpsychology.org/html/facts_molestation.html</ref>. Moreover, amongst children who were sexually abused, the proportion that report their abuser was homosexual is within the range of the proportion of homosexuals in the general population<ref>Are children at risk for sexual abuse by homosexuals? (1994, July 1). PubMed. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8008535/</ref>. Given that most attacks on the homosexual community come from those who claim that, for example, gay married men are more likely to molest children than straight married men, it is reasonable to simply assert that homosexuals are not more likely to engage in child abuse, as they are incorrect in that assertion even if under some definitions the fact is true.

In short, the best treatment broadly by society for homosexuals is tolerance. Homosexuality is relatively unchangeable, and discrimination has been shown to be associated with further psychological harm to this group which already naturally faces worse mental health issues. Tolerance does not mean worship, or people being prideful that they're gay, but those who are gay and engage in associated lifestyles should not be demonized.

### Policy Implications

In accordance with tolerance being the best strategy for helping improve the well-being of homosexuals, policy legalizing same-sex marriage and ensuring legal protection should be promoted. The question of same-sex parents is a bit more complex and will be discussed in turn.

#### Same-Sex Marriage

Same-sex married couples have a higher suicide rate relative to opposite-sex married couples<ref>Erlangsen, A., Drefahl, S., Haas, A., Bjorkenstam, C., Nordentoft, M., & Andersson, G. (2019). Suicide among persons who entered same-sex and opposite-sex marriage in Denmark and Sweden, 1989–2016: a binational, register-based cohort study. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, 74(1), 78–83. https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2019-213009</ref>. However, research has also suggested that married LGBT adults are healthier and happier than single LGBT adults<ref>Legal recognition of same-sex relationships in the United States: A social science perspective. (n.d.). https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0003-066X.61.6.607</ref><ref>Eckart, K. (2017, April 13). Married LGBT older adults are healthier, happier than singles, study finds. UW News. https://www.washington.edu/news/2017/04/13/married-lgbt-older-adults-are-healthier-happier-than-singles-study-finds/</ref>, which means that marriage likely increases the quality of life of homosexuals even if they still have higher suicidality relative to heterosexuals.

Laws allowing same-sex marriage appear to have general positive health effects. This has been seen with research suggesting positive mental health outcomes of legalizing same-sex marriage<ref>Raifman, J., Moscoe, E., Austin, S. B., & McConnell, M. (2017). Difference-in-Differences Analysis of the association between State Same-Sex Marriage Policies and adolescent Suicide Attempts.

In sickness and in health: Same-sex marriage laws and sexually transmitted infections. ideas.repec.org. https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/socmed/v75y2012i8p1329-1341.html</ref>, a proxy for risky homosexual behavior, and lower healthcare use among sexual minorities<ref>Hatzenbuehler, M.

American Journal of Public Health, 102(2), 285–291. https://doi.org/10.2105/ajph.2011.300382</ref>. A lot of this likely has to do with increased freedom but it also probably also reflects cultural shifts that emerge following such laws which legitimate same-sex marriage. Moreover, the additional legal and financial rights, benefits, and protections afforded to same-sex couples through legalizing same-sex marriage is another likely culprit for this<ref>Pawelski, J. G., Perrin, E. C., Foy, J. M., Allen, C. E., Crawford, J. E., Del Monte, M., Kaufman, M., Klein, J. D., Smith, K., Springer, S., Tanner, J. L., & Vickers, D. L. (2006).

#### Legal Protection

Anti-discrimination and anti-bullying laws appear to increase quality of life for sexual minorities by reducing discrimination and bullying<ref>Barron, L. G., & Hebl, M. (2013). The force of law: The effects of sexual orientation antidiscrimination legislation on interpersonal discrimination in employment. Psychology, Public Policy, and Law, 19(2), 191–205. https://doi.org/10.1037/a0028350</ref><ref>Meyer, I. H., Luo, F., Wilson, B. D., & Stone, D. M. (2019).

LGBT Health, 6(1), 9–14. https://doi.org/10.1089/lgbt.2018.0194</ref>. However, even with anti-discrimination laws, discrimination against sexual minorities can persist.

#### Same-Sex Parents

Research on the outcomes of children with same-sex parents compared to heterosexual parents is extremely mixed. Schumm (2016) found that the research in general is of very poor quality and that more research is needed to accurately establish the relationship. Nonetheless, he acknowledged that if one only considers one-time studies of either young children or children who spent very little time in a same-sex household, one would conclude there is no difference in outcomes. On the other hand, if one looks at longitudinal studies and studies that look at adolescents and young adults, one would conclude there are differences, where same-sex parents have worse outcomes<ref>Schumm, W. R. (2016). A review and critique of research on Same-Sex Parenting and adoption. Psychological Reports, 119(3), 641–760. https://doi.org/10.1177/0033294116665594</ref>. 

Looking at meta-analyses, Fedewa et al. (2014) finds that children raised by same-gender parents have better psychological adjustment and no differences in cognitive development<ref>Fedewa, A. L., Black, W. W., & Ahn, S. (2014). Children and Adolescents with Same-Gender Parents: A Meta-Analytic Approach in Assessing Outcomes. Journal of GLBT Family Studies, 11(1), 1–34. https://doi.org/10.1080/1550428x.2013.869486</ref>. Crowl et al. (2007) finds that children raised by same-sex parents fare equally well<ref>Crowl, A., Ahn, S., & Baker, J. (2008). A Meta-Analysis of Developmental Outcomes for Children of Same-Sex and Heterosexual Parents. Journal of GLBT Family Studies, 4(3), 385–407. https://doi.org/10.1080/15504280802177615</ref>. Finally, Schofield (2016) found several negative associations between living with gay or lesbian parents and several outcomes. It seems that the research on this issue is not completely settled<ref>Knowing what we don’t know: A meta-analysis of children raised by gay or lesbian parents. (n.d.). ResearchGate. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336288130_Knowing_what_we_don%27t_know_A_meta-analysis_of_children_raised_by_gay_or_lesbian_parents</ref>.

Therefore, I am skeptical of policies which treat same-sex couples identically in adoption as opposite-sex couples. More research should be done which includes a wide range of controls to see what variables best predict an adopted child's success in life, and whether the sexual orientation of their parents plays any role. Until then, caution should be given to identical treatment.

## Sex Atypicality: Transgenderism

Estimates about the prevalence of a transgender identity range from 0.5-1.5%, depending on the study and age group<ref>Collin, L., Reisner, S. L., Tangpricha, V., & Goodman, M. (2016). Prevalence of transgender depends on the “Case” definition: a Systematic review. The Journal of Sexual Medicine, 13(4), 613–626. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsxm.2016.02.001</ref><ref>Zucker, K. J. (2017). Epidemiology of gender dysphoria and transgender identity. Sexual Health, 14(5), 404. https://doi.org/10.1071/sh17067</ref><ref>The Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law. (2023, July 10). How many adults and youth identify as transgender in the United States? - Williams Institute. Williams Institute. https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/trans-adults-united-states/</ref>. Among US adults, about 0.5% identify as transgender, compared to about 1.4% among youth ages 13-17<ref>The Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law. (2023, July 10). How many adults and youth identify as transgender in the United States? - Williams Institute. Williams Institute. https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/trans-adults-united-states/</ref>.

Those who identify as transgender generally had gender dysphoria, and from there "transitioned" to change their social and physical attributes to be more consistent with those of the opposite biological sex. Gender dysphoria appears to have some genetic component to it, as multiple pieces of evidence suggest:

- Gender identity is approximately 30-60% heritable<ref>Polderman, T. J. C., Kreukels, B. P. C., Irwig, M. S., Beach, L., Chan, Y., Derks, E. M., Esteva, I., Ehrenfeld, J., Heijer, M. D., Posthuma, D., Raynor, L., Tishelman, A., & Davis, L. K. (2018). The Biological Contributions to Gender Identity and Gender Diversity: Bringing data to the table. Behavior Genetics, 48(2), 95–108. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10519-018-9889-z</ref>.
- The brains of transgender people exhibit features resembling those of their experienced gender<ref>Guillamon, A., Junque, C., & Gómez-Gil, E. (2016). A review of the status of brain structure research in transsexualism. Archives of Sexual Behavior, 45(7), 1615–1648. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-016-0768-5</ref>, despite the majority of features resembling those from their natal sex<ref>Frigerio, A., Ballerini, L., & Hernández, M. V. (2021). Structural, functional, and metabolic brain differences as a function of gender identity or sexual orientation: A Systematic Review of the Human Neuroimaging literature. Archives of Sexual Behavior, 50(8), 3329–3352. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-021-02005-9</ref>. However, there is a high correlation between transgenderism and homosexuality, which makes it difficult to entable correlates of sexual orientation and gender identity<ref>Smith, E. S., Junger, J., Derntl, B., & Habel, U. (2015). The transsexual brain – A review of findings on the neural basis of transsexualism. Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews, 59, 251–266. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2015.09.008</ref>. After controlling for sexual orientation, transgender people had relatively similar brain structures for the exception of parts that mediate their own body perception<ref>Burke, S. M., Manzouri, A. H., & Savic, I. (2017). Structural connections in the brain in relation to gender identity and sexual orientation. Scientific Reports, 7(1). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-17352-8</ref>.
- This is consistent with research suggesting that while there is a genetic role for the development of gender identity disorders<ref>Diamond, M. (2013). Transsexuality among twins: identity concordance, transition, rearing, and orientation. International Journal of Transgenderism, 14(1), 24–38. https://doi.org/10.1080/15532739.2013.750222</ref>, transgenderism does not seem to be associated with any molecular mutations of some of the main genes involved in sexual differentiation<ref>Lombardo, F., Toselli, L., Grassetti, D., Paoli, D., Masciandaro, P., Valentini, F., Lenzi, A., & Gandini, L. (2013). Hormone and genetic study in male to female transsexual patients. PubMed, 36(8), 550–557. https://doi.org/10.3275/8813</ref>.
- This is also consistent with evidence suggesting that prenatal hormone exposure, while having an effect on sex-typed activity interests and engagement, as well as spatial abilities, has no major effect on gender identity or sexual orientation<ref>Hines, M. (2006). Prenatal testosterone and gender-related behaviour. European Journal of Endocrinology, 155(suppl_1), S115–S121. https://doi.org/10.1530/eje.1.02236</ref><ref>Berenbaum, S. A., & Beltz, A. M. (2016). How early hormones shape gender development. Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences, 7, 53–60. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cobeha.2015.11.011</ref>.
- Mothers of boys with gender identity disorder had borderline personality disorder at a vastly higher rate than mothers of normal boys<ref>Marantz, S., & Coates, S. (1991). Mothers of Boys with Gender Identity Disorder: A Comparison of Matched Controls. Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, 30(2), 310–315. https://doi.org/10.1097/00004583-199103000-00022</ref>. The associated child-rearing attitudes and practices that discourage autonomy may potentially contribute to the development of gender identity disorder in the children.

Intuitively, allowing for the body to correespond to the brain's desires would decrease psychological suffering, but this doesn't mean that transition is the best way to deal with the disorder. An alternative might be counselling to help someone accept their existing body, which could lead to lowered healthcare costs, reduced harms associated with medical interventions, less societal restructuring, and perhaps even better general psychological outcomes. Furthermore, while there is a neurological component to gender dysphoria, much of it is confounded by sexual orientation and when controlling for that, only parts of the brain associated with body image appear to be different. It may be possible to have interventions in place to help these people accept their existing body.

To my knowledge, research attempting to use alternative ways to treat gender dysphoria is extremely lacking. There is one case study documenting a successful treatment of gender dysphoria using pimozide<ref>Puri, B. K., & Singh, I. (1996). The Successful Treatment of a Gender Dysphoric Patient with Pimozide. Australian & New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, 30(3), 422–425. https://doi.org/10.3109/00048679609065010</ref>. Turban et al. (2019) found that there was an association between recalled exposure to gender identity conversion efforts and poor mental health outcomes<ref>Turban, J. L., Beckwith, N., Reisner, S. L., & Keuroghlian, A. S. (2020). Association between recalled exposure to gender identity conversion efforts and psychological distress and suicide attempts among transgender adults. JAMA Psychiatry, 77(1), 68. https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2019.2285</ref>. However, the study was rife with problems, including poor sampling, a poor definition of conversion therapy which doesn't distinguish between clearly unethical interventions and potentially good-faith interventions, a poor mental health metric, and lack of control for pre-conversion effort mental health status<ref>D’Angelo, R., Syrulnik, E., Ayad, S., Marchiano, L., Kenny, D. T., & Clarke, P. (2020). One size does not fit all: In support of Psychotherapy for Gender Dysphoria. Archives of Sexual Behavior, 50(1), 7–16. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-020-01844-2</ref>. Thus, there is no significant evidence suggesting alternative ways to treat gender dysphoria are ineffective. Given that there are significant personal, social, and physical effects of existing gender dysphoria treatments more research should be done in this area to help figure out how to best treat gender dysphoria.

**Note on ROGD:** Rapid onset gender dysphoria (ROGD) is essentially a hypothesized diagnosis for a portion of teen or young adult children who rapidly become gender dysphoric due to social influence or “social contagion” affecting youth vulnerable to mental disorders/illness<ref>Littman, L. (2018). Parent reports of adolescents and young adults perceived to show signs of a rapid onset of gender dysphoria. PLoS ONE, 13(8), e0202330. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0202330</ref>. It should be noted that this was an emerging hypothesis derived from surveys of parents of gender dysphoric children, as opposed to being an analysis done by actual psychiatrists interviewing such gender dysphoric children<ref>Littman, L. (2019). Correction: Parent reports of adolescents and young adults perceived to show signs of a rapid onset of gender dysphoria. PLoS ONE, 14(3), e0214157. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0214157</ref>. This at the very least raises questions about the legitimacy of ROGD as a medical category. There has been testing done to see if there is a relationship between recency of belief regarding one’s gender and mental health problems. If the ROGD hypothesis was true, people who had a higher recency of belief would likely be those who had more susceptibility to mental problems. However, research has suggested that if anything, the opposite is the case, suggesting that ROGD is not a real thing or only affects a very small proportion of gender dysphoric individuals<ref>Bauer, G. R., Lawson, M. L., & Metzger, D. L. (2022). Do Clinical Data from Transgender Adolescents Support the Phenomenon of “Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria”? The Journal of Pediatrics, 243, 224-227.e2. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2021.11.020</ref>.

**Note on "Desistance":** While I will not comment on the desistance debate as from what I've seen there's a lot of conflicting evidence on it and the issue is relatively unimportant to me, children referred for gender dysphoria have high levels of suicidality<ref>Self-Harm and suicidality in children referred for gender dysphoria. (n.d.). ResearchGate. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/300420411_Self-Harm_and_Suicidality_in_Children_Referred_for_Gender_Dysphoria</ref>. Children with persistent gender dysphoria have gender dysphoria to a much more extreme extent, suggesting that there may be some predictability to who desists and who does not<ref>Wallien, M. S., & Cohen-Kettenis, P. T. (2008). Psychosexual outcome of Gender-Dysphoric Children. Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, 47(12), 1413–1423. https://doi.org/10.1097/chi.0b013e31818956b9</ref><ref>Steensma, T. D., McGuire, J. K., Kreukels, B. P., Beekman, A. J., & Cohen-Kettenis, P. T. (2013). Factors Associated with Desistence and Persistence of Childhood Gender Dysphoria: A Quantitative Follow-Up Study. Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, 52(6), 582–590. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2013.03.016</ref>, irrespective of the actual desistance rate.

The best evidence suggests that gender transition, medically and socially, appears to have positive health effects on transgender individuals. This will be discussed in later sections.

### Psychological Profile

Transgender people appear to have worsened mental health and increased suicidality. Some of this is a product of discrimination against transgender people. They also appear to engage in more sexually risky behaviors. Social support is associated with better menta health outcomes.

**Mental Health**

Transgender people have poor mental health relative to the general population<ref>Newcomb, M. E., Hill, R., Buehler, K., Ryan, D. T., Whitton, S. W., & Mustanski, B. (2019).

**Suicide**

There is increased suicidal ideation and attempts among transgender people. Notable risk factors include psychological distress, substance abuse, discrimination, familial rejection, conversion therapy, and physical abuse. Notable protective factors include supportive families, hormone therapy and/or surgical care, and living in a state with gender identity nondiscrimination laws<ref>Barboza, G.

Transgender people tend to have poor healthcare experiences<ref>Howard, S. D., Lee, K. L., Nathan, A. G., Wenger, H. C., Chin, M. H., & Cook, S. C. (2019). Healthcare experiences of transgender people of color. Journal of General Internal Medicine, 34(10), 2068–2074. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-019-05179-0</ref>, with one study reporting that 19% of transgender/gender-nonconforming individuals say they have been refused medical care based on their transgender/gender-nonconforming identity<ref>Kattari, S.

This suggests that negative healthcare experiences are primarily due to a minority of healthcare providers as opposed to being due to wide numbers of healthcare providers exhibiting bias.

LGBT people report high rates of workplace harassment and employment discrimination<ref>Sears, B., & Mallory, C. (2011, July 1). Documented Evidence of Employment Discrimination & Its Effects on LGBT People. https://escholarship.org/uc/item/03m1g5sg</ref>. Schilt & Wiswall (2008) found that while transgender people have the same human capital after their transitions, their workplace experiences often change radically. Average earnings for female-to-male transgender workers increase slightly following their gender transitions, while average earnings for male-to-female transgender workers fall by nearly 1/3<ref>Schilt, K., & Wiswall, M. (2008). Before and after: gender transitions, human capital, and workplace experiences. The B E Journal of Economic Analysis & Policy, 8(1). https://doi.org/10.2202/1935-1682.1862</ref>.

School harassment due to transgender identity is pervasive, and harassment is negatively associated with feelings of safety. When schools took action to reduce harassment, students reported greater connections to school personnel, increasing feelings of safety<ref>McGuire, J. K., Anderson, C. R., Toomey, R. B., & Russell, S. T. (2010). School Climate for Transgender Youth: A mixed method investigation of student experiences and school responses. Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 39(10), 1175–1188. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10964-010-9540-7</ref>. Transgender youth perceived as more gender incongruent had higher odds of bullying victimization and emotional distress relative to those perceived as very congruent with their biological sex<ref>Gower, A.

LGBT Health, 5(5), 312–319. https://doi.org/10.1089/lgbt.2017.0176</ref>. LGBT youth who attended a high school with a gay-straight alliance (GSA) report significantly more favorable outcomes related to school experiences, alcohol use, and psychological distress<ref>Offsetting risks: High school gay-straight alliances and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youth. (n.d.). https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F2329-0382.1.S.81</ref>.

Transgender people report a high amount of discrimination in public accommodations, with one study reporting that 65% of transgender people reported public accommodations discrimination in the past 12 months<ref>Reisner, S. L., Hughto, J. M. W., Dunham, E. E., Heflin, K. J., Begenyi, J. B. G., Coffey‐esquivel, J., & Cahill, S. (2015). Legal Protections in public Accommodations Settings: A critical public health issue for transgender and Gender‐Nonconforming people. Milbank Quarterly, 93(3), 484–515. https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-0009.12127</ref>.

Much of the public eye surrounding transgender people examines transgender women in particular, and thus trans women receive the overwhelming majority of societal fascination, consternation, and demonization. This is theorized to be due to what is called "trans-misogyny", which is steeped in the assumption that femaleness and femininity are inferior to, and exist primarily for the benefit of, maleness and masculinity<ref>Serano, J. (2007). Trans-misogyny primer. Seal Press. https://www.juliaserano.com/av/TransmisogynyPrimer-Serano.pdf</ref>.

**Note on Bullying:** Transgender youth are more likely to be bullied and to perpetuate bullying. However, transgender identities are more strongly associated with perpetration of bullying than subjection to bullying<ref>Heino, E., Ellonen, N., & Kaltiala, R. (2021). Transgender identity is associated with bullying involvement among Finnish adolescents. Frontiers in Psychology, 11. https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.612424</ref>.

**Disease**

A large proportion of MTFs engage in risky sexual behaviors and have high rates of HIV infection. Prevalence rates of HIV and risk behaviors are low among FTMs<ref>Herbst, J. H., Jacobs, E. D., Finlayson, T. J., McKleroy, V. S., Neumann, M. S., & Crepaz, N. (2024, May 6). Estimating HIV prevalence and risk behaviors of transgender persons in the United States: a systematic review. Medscape. https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/571708?form=fpf</ref>. Interestingly however, there is a positive correlation between exposure to transphobia and HIV risk behavior<ref>Sugano, E., Nemoto, T., & Operario, D. (2005). The impact of exposure to transphobia on HIV risk behavior in a sample of transgendered women of color in San Francisco. AIDS and Behavior, 10(2). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10461-005-9040-z</ref>. It is difficult to suggest how the causality operates in this relation but it is an interesting correlation nonetheless.

**Social Support**

Social support of transgender people from friends and family, as well as self-acceptance, positively predicts quality of life along a variety of metrics<ref>Olson, K. R., Durwood, L., DeMeules, M., & McLaughlin, K. A. (2016). Mental health of transgender children who are supported in their identities.

### Gender-Affirming Treatment

As I said before, I am skeptical of whether "gender-affirming treatment" is the best solution to the issue of gender dysphoria, but research that does exist suggests it is. It is unfortunate that alternative treatments have not been meaningfully considered. I will discuss aspects of gender affirming treatment in turn:

**Transition: Positive Effects**

The vast majority of the evidence suggests that gender transition improves gender dysphoria, psychological symptoms, quality of life, and sexual function<ref>IJ TRANSGENDER - Chapter 6.2.6: Treatment results.

Trajectories of Adolescents Treated with Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Analogues for Gender Dysphoria.

Moreover, puberty blockers reduce dysphoria and reduce the invasiveness of future surgeries<ref>Giordano, S., & Holm, S. (2020). Is puberty delaying treatment ‘experimental treatment’? International Journal of Transgender Health, 21(2), 113–121. https://doi.org/10.1080/26895269.2020.1747768</ref>.

There is mixed evidence on whether puberty blockers reduce cognitive ability which I would have to look into more before having a full opinion on it<ref>Wojniusz, S., Callens, N., Sütterlin, S., Andersson, S., De Schepper, J., Gies, I., Vanbesien, J., De Waele, K., Van Aken, S., Craen, M., Vögele, C., Cools, M., & Haraldsen, I.

**Note on Fertility Concerns:** Puberty blockers do not cause infertility although may pause the development of things which affect fertility potential<ref>Cheng, P. J., Pastuszak, A. W., Myers, J. B., Goodwin, I. A., & Hotaling, J. M. (2019). Fertility concerns of the transgender patient.

The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health, 5(6), 385. https://doi.org/10.1016/s2352-4642(21)00139-5</ref>. Hormone therapy can affect fertility, although this is potentially reversible. Gender-affirming surgery that involves hysterectomy and oophorectomy in transmen or orchiectomy in transwomen results in permanent sterility<ref>Cheng, P. J., Pastuszak, A. W., Myers, J. B., Goodwin, I. A., & Hotaling, J. M. (2019). Fertility concerns of the transgender patient. Translational Andrology and Urology, 8(3), 209–218. https://doi.org/10.21037/tau.2019.05.09</ref>.

**Note on Detransition:** Detransition and regret following a gender transition are related but distinct concepts. However, they are often studied alongside each other. Instances of regret and detransition following sex reassignment surgery exist, but research has generally found it to be very rare. Data varies, but the vast majority of research identified in reviewing the literature as well as meta-analysis suggests that the rates of either are less than 5%<ref>Bustos, V. P., Bustos, S. S., Mascaro, A., Del Corral, G., Forte, A. J., Ciudad, P., Kim, E. A., Langstein, H. N., & Manrique, O. J. (2021).

### Policy Implications

#### Public Accommodations

Transgender people appear to fare better in terms of mental health when there are public accommodations for them, such as inclusive bathroom policies and inclusive housing. This comes with no clear negative impacts. Sexual assaults do not appear to occur at higher rates when there are inclusive bathroom policies. Funnily enough, it is men who are the most concerned about transgender-inclusive bathroom policies, in spite of the fact that they don’t have to experience the issues they fear women will, of “trans women predators”.

Transgender teens with restricted bathroom access are at higher risk of sexual assault than the population average<ref>Transgender teens with restricted bathroom access at higher risk of sexual assault. (2019, May 7). News. https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/transgender-teens-restricted-bathroom-access-sexual-assault/</ref>. This makes perfect sense if having two genders in a washroom meant traditionally for one creates social conditions which lead to sexual assaults occurring.

Denial of access to gender-appropriate college housing or bathrooms is positively associated with suicidality for transgender individuals<ref>Seelman, K. L. (2016). Transgender adults’ access to college bathrooms and housing and the relationship to suicidality. Journal of Homosexuality, 63(10), 1378–1399. https://doi.org/10.1080/00918369.2016.1157998</ref>.

Unfortunately, transender people still appear to suffer from problems in their gender-appropriate restrooms, with denial of access, verbal harassment, and physical assault not being uncommon for transgender people to experience<ref>The Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law. (2023, November 30). Gendered restrooms and minority stress - Williams Institute. Williams Institute. https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/gendered-restrooms-minority-stress/</ref>.

Most research suggests that allowing transgender people into the gender-appropriate washroom does not cause increases in incidents of privacy and safety violations in such spaces<ref>Hasenbush, A., Flores, A. R., & Herman, J. L. (2018). Gender Identity Nondiscrimination Laws in Public Accommodations: a Review of Evidence Regarding Safety and Privacy in Public Restrooms, Locker Rooms, and Changing Rooms. Sexuality Research and Social Policy, 16(1), 70–83. https://doi.org/10.1007/s13178-018-0335-z</ref><ref>Murchison, G. R., Agénor, M., Reisner, S. L., & Watson, R. J. (2019). School restroom and locker room restrictions and sexual assault risk among transgender youth. PEDIATRICS, 143(6). https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2018-2902</ref>. I did locate one study which suggested otherwise<ref>Target Study – WOMAN means something. (2019, January 11). https://womanmeanssomething.com/targetstudy/</ref>. However, this study looked at media reports as opposed to statistics and self-reporting data. Therefore, it is necessarily biased towards media which may paint transgender people in a more or less fair light than in reality and may exaggerate implicitly the actual incidence of sexual assault in such washrooms.

The lack of a positive relationship between inclusive bathroom policy and safety and privacy violations might partially help explain why men are more concerned about transgender women in female bathrooms than women are, despite not being the demographic who is experiencing the issues they care about<ref>Stones, R. J. (2016). Which Gender is More Concerned About Transgender Women in Female Bathrooms? Gender Issues, 34(3), 275–291. https://doi.org/10.1007/s12147-016-9181-6</ref>. This could be seen as a sort of sexist condescension or a lack of understanding of the actual effects of allowing transgender women into female washrooms. Regardless, it is fairly ironic.

In unisex washrooms, the story may be a bit different. The vast majority of reported sexual assaults at public swimming pools in the UK take place in unisex changing rooms. Just under 90% of complaints involving sexual assaults, voyeurism, and harassment happen in such changing rooms. This is despite the fact that unisex changing rooms account for less than half of the changing areas across the UK<ref>Hosie, R. (2018, September 15). Unisex changing rooms put women at danger of sexual assault, data reveals | The Independent. The Independent. https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/women/sexual-assault-unisex-changing-rooms-sunday-times-women-risk-a8519086.html</ref>.

#### Sports

There are many sports organizations which allow transgender women to compete in the female category, but have certain restrictions with the intent of ensuring fairness. For example, the International Olympic Committee requires total serum testosterone levels to be suppressed below 10 nmol/L for at least 12 months prior to and during competition<ref>Erdener, U., Ljungqvist, A., Bermon, S., Monaco Institute of Sports Medicine & Surgery, IAAF Medical & Scientific Senior Consultant, Beloff, M., Conway, G., Genel, M., Yale University School of Medicine, Harper, J., Prof Angelica Linden Hirschberg Department of Woman & Child Health, Division of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Karolinska Institutet, Martinez Patino, M.

While these policies can be argued to be attempts at being more inclusive towards transgender people, a population which reports generally feeling excluded from sports<ref>Wayback machine. (n.d.). https://web.archive.org/web/20180719224455/https://lra.le.ac.uk/bitstream/2381/38576/6/Transgender%20paper.pdf</ref>, research suggests that they likely inhibit the fairness of many sports overall:

*'''Anthropometric Factors -''' Height and skeletal parameters remain virtually unaltered in transgender women, which can confer sporting advantages in sports where height is an advantage<ref>Hilton, E. N.; Lundberg, T. R. Transgender Women in The Female Category of Sport: Is the Male Performance Advantage Removed by Testosterone Suppression?. Preprints 2020, 2020050226. https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202005.0226.v1</ref>.
*'''Muscle Mass -''' Longitudinal data shows a clear pattern of very modest to negligible changes in muscle mass and strength in transgender women suppressing testosterone for at least 12 months<ref>Hilton, E. N.; Lundberg, T. R. Transgender Women in The Female Category of Sport: Is the Male Performance Advantage Removed by Testosterone Suppression?. Preprints 2020, 2020050226. https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202005.0226.v1</ref>.
*'''Endurance-Based Performance -''' Weak cross-sectional evidence suggests that endurance-based performance differences reduce roughly to parity following testosterone suppression<ref>Hilton, E. N.; Lundberg, T. R. Transgender Women in The Female Category of Sport: Is the Male Performance Advantage Removed by Testosterone Suppression?. Preprints 2020, 2020050226. https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202005.0226.v1</ref>.
*'''Hemoglobin -''' Hemoglobin level disparities are eliminated following hormone therapy<ref>Harper, J., O’Donnell, E., Khorashad, B. S., McDermott, H., & Witcomb, G. L. (2021). How does hormone transition in transgender women change body composition, muscle strength and haemoglobin? Systematic review with a focus on the implications for sport participation. British Journal of Sports Medicine, 55(15), 865–872. https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2020-103106</ref>.

Thus, transgender women in many metrics, but not all, are physically superior to cisgender women, making their inclusion into women’s sports in many cases unfair. However, it should be noted that none of this research is looking at elite-level comparisons between transgender and cisgender women, which may affect the relative differences. Moreover, there may be some sports such as endurance sports where transgender women do not exhibit any significant advantages to cisgender women. There needs to be a more rigorous examination of these issues if we wish to balance the fairness of elite sports with the desires of transgender women to feel included.

I’m therefore against transgender women being allowed to compete in many elite-level sports where they may have an unfair advantage. This however wouldn’t extend to lower-level sports which are more casual and in which the stakes are less severe, such as high school sports. In those cases, I don’t see a significant issue with letting transgender women compete in the women’s category in spite of risks of an unfair competitive advantage.

SIDENOTE: Jones et al. (2017) is sometimes cited as a literature review suggesting that transgender male or female individuals do not have an athletic advantage at any stage of their transition<ref>Jones, B. A., Arcelus, J., Bouman, W. P., & Haycraft, E. (2016). Sport and Transgender People: A Systematic review of the literature relating to sport participation and competitive sport policies. Sports Medicine, 47(4), 701–716. https://doi.org/10.1007/s40279-016-0621-y</ref>, but the authors later clarified in Jones et al (2020) that the paper suggested that there wasn’t direct evidence at the time that would support the IOC policy or other sporting organizational policies<ref>Jones, B. A., Arcelus, J., Bouman, W. P., & Haycraft, E. (2020). Authors’ reply to Richardson and Chen: Comment on “Sport and Transgender People: A Systematic review of the literature relating to sport participation and Competitive Sport Policies.” Sports Medicine, 50(10), 1861–1862. https://doi.org/10.1007/s40279-020-01324-6</ref>. Rather than the paper being for transgender female inclusion into women’s sports, it is agnostic to the question.

#### Military

Allowing transgender people in the military would allow for a larger military with no negative effects on the effectiveness of such a military force. Moreover, gender-affirming therapy in the military would constitute minimal expenditures and would improve the ability for transgender people to participate effectively in the military<ref>Schaefer, A. G., Radha, I. P., Kadiyala, S., Kavanagh, J., Engel, C. C., Williams, K. M., & Kress, A. M. (2016, June 30). Assessing the implications of allowing transgender personnel to serve openly. RAND. https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1530.html</ref><ref>Okros, A., & Scott, D. (2014). Gender Identity in the Canadian Forces: A review of possible impacts on Operational Effectiveness. Armed Forces & Society, 1–14. https://doi.org/10.1177/0095327X14535371</ref>. There is generally support for transgender people to serve openly in the military amongst military personnel, at least in the United States<ref>Dunlap, S. L., Holloway, I. W., Pickering, C. E., Tzen, M., Goldbach, J. T., & Castro, C. A. (2020). Support for Transgender Military Service from Active Duty United States Military Personnel. Sexuality Research and Social Policy, 18(1), 137–143. https://doi.org/10.1007/s13178-020-00437-x</ref>, although the military nonetheless appears to be less tolerant than the general population of transgender people, due to political ideology and religious affiliation differences<ref>Ender, M. G., Rohall, D. E., & Matthews, M. D. (2015). Cadet and Civilian Undergraduate Attitudes toward Transgender People. Armed Forces & Society, 42(2), 427–435. https://doi.org/10.1177/0095327x15575278</ref>.

#### Prisons

Data suggests that transgender women in male prisons are greatly disproportionately sexually abused compared to non-transgender inmates in men’s prisons<ref>just detention international. (2013). Targets for abuse: transgender inmates and prisoner rape. In Just Detention International. https://justdetention.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/FS-Targets-For-Abuse-Transgender-Inmates-And-Prisoner-Rape.pdf</ref>. At the same time, data from England and Wales suggests that nearly half of transgender prisoners have been convicted for sexual offenses, compared to 19% of males and 4% of females in the overall prison population<ref>Biggs, M. (2020, May 17). The Transition from Sex to Gender in English Prisons: Human Rights and Queer Theory. https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/43f2t</ref>. This lends credence to the hypothesis that there may be male inmates who insincerely attempt to identify as transgender to enter women’s spaces where they can engage in predatory behavior. Thus there is a very difficult dilemma posed. If however, we do hold that we should try and ensure that sincere transgender women do enter women’s prisons where they’ll be safe from sexual assault, we must take great care in rooting out false positives as not doing so could have disastrous consequences.

## The Modern Narrative on Sexism

A common assumption, similar to race, is that all disparities that exist on the basis of gender must necessarily be due to discrimination. As shown in earlier sections, this is clearly not true. Men and women have different interests, different comparative advantages cognitively, different personalities. Thus, they should have different outcomes in nearly every domain of society. Nonetheless, it is possible that bias, or "sexism", can play a role in some of these disparities to some degree.

### Economic Disparities

#### STEM: Little Bias

Stewart-Williams & Halsey (2021) found that there are a number of reasons why women are underrepresented in STEM, a mix of biological and social causes<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1177/0890207020962326</ref>:

*Interests - Men tend to be more interested in working with things, women people; men tend to express more interest in STEM; Men place more interest in career success and less in work-life balance and time for friends and family. These interests have remained stable across time and cultures, emerge in early development, and are shaped by prenatal hormones, suggesting a biological cause. This is likely evolutionarily due to women requiring a larger minimum biological investment into their children, with pregnancy and breastfeeding.
*Cognitive ability - Men have higher spatial ability, women higher linguistic ability. It is far from obvious that on net stereotypes favor boys or girls in terms of mental ability, suggesting little to no role of stereotyping. These differences have been found in early development, are linked to sex hormones, exist cross-culturally, and have not been lowered by efforts without diminishing returns. These differences might be due to men being more likely to be hunters.
*Variability - Males have higher variability in various cognitive capacities, as well as general cognitive ability. Variability is also found in other traits such as height, birth weight, and BMI, variability in cognitive attributes shows up in early childhood, and variability differences are found in other animals. This may be due to more variable male reproductive success, or that the more heterogametic sex just happens to be more variable.
*Discrimination - There is a large number of studies indicating discrimination against women, the sheer number of which strongly implies some anti-female bias in STEM, although there is also a similarly large number of studies suggesting no bias or an anti-male bias. Overall, the evidence seems mixed, either because there exists pockets of anti-male or anti-female bias in various domains and areas of STEM, or because the findings are inconclusive, suggesting bias cannot be hugely prevalent. This suggests that discrimination only plays a small role in sex disparities in STEM.

In sum, there are many factors at play.

**Note on the Gender Paradox:**

Stoet & Geary (2018) found that girls performed similarly to or better than boys in science in most countries, although the sex differences in the magnitude of relative academic strengths and pursuit of STEM degrees rose with increases in national gender equality<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797617741719</ref>. They hypothesized from this that life-quality pressures in less gender-equal countries prompt girls' and women's engagement with STEM subjects. This study however fails replication when using other measures of the same variables used<ref>https://www.genderscilab.org/blog/gender-equality-paradox-monkey-business-or-how-to-tell-spurious-causal-stories-about-nation-level-achievement-by-women-in-stem</ref>, suggesting there may be no effect of gender equality on differences in the pursuit of STEM degrees. While the theory posited in the original study is undermined by the study's failure to replicate, these findings are still consistent with a biological explanation for gender inequality, as even in the case of there being no relationship between convergence of academic strengths and STEM enrollment it would imply that women simply lack interest in doing STEM careers regardless of their relative academic attainment.

Isungset et al. (2021) finds that as gender equality has increased over the 20th century the heritability of lifetime income has also increased<ref>https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e5wjk/</ref>. Given that lifetime income is correlated substantially by educational level and type of education, we can use this as a proxy for the heritability of pursuit of STEM careers over time. Using this would suggest that the heritability of pursuit of STEM careers has increased over time, even though convergence in general academics between men and women has not produced a convergence in STEM career pursuit, pointing to a genetic cause for sex differences in pursuit of STEM. A genetic explanation for gender differences in STEM is consistent with research suggesting that said gender differences are influenced by noncognitive traits, behaviors, and interests<ref>https://oxfordre.com/economics/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190625979.001.0001/acrefore-9780190625979-e-663</ref>. It should be noted however that Isungset et al. (2021) also pointed out that the heritability of lifetime income was still lower for women than for men, suggesting that environmental factors such as discrimination could still play a significant role in gender inequalities, even if they have decreased over time<ref>https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e5wjk/</ref>.

Attempting to counter a biological explanation for gender inequality, Breda et al. (2020) finds that the stereotype associating math to men is stronger in more egalitarian and developed countries, and is strongly associated with various measures of female underrepresentation in math-intensive fields<ref>https://www.pnas.org/content/117/49/31063</ref>. Therefore, the gender paradox if it exists is instead due to the reassertion of gender stereotypes occurring as societies become more gender equal. Economic development reshapes rather than suppresses gender norms, with an emergence of new or more forms of social differentiation across genders. However, the causality of this isn't clear. It may for instance be the case that people are observing the biological reality that women aren't attending STEM careers in spite of increased gender equality and forming those stereotypes as a consequence of that initial observation. Thus, this isn't inconsistent with biological explanations for gender inequality.

#### Housing: Pro-Female Bias

Men are disproportionately discriminated against in terms of housing, due to preferences rather than statistical discrimination<ref>https://crese.univ-fcomte.fr/uploads/wp/WP-2018-04.pdf</ref>. This suggests that these are irrational and unjust biases rather than justified actions undertaken by rental agents.

### Schooling: Little Bias

There is a small female advantage in general scholastic achievement. This is largest for language courses and smallest for math courses<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261953087_Gender_Differences_in_Scholastic_Achievement_A_Meta-Analysis</ref>. Lindberg et al. (2010) in fact found no gender difference in mathematical performance<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3057475/</ref>.

Some experimental and quasi-experimental evidence suggests that there is no association between perceived male gender of a student and teachers' grading<ref>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02602938.2019.1638885</ref><ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8297848/</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0742051X22002001</ref>, and that on the aggregate there is no gender bias in grading in any subject<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0742051X22002001#sec4</ref>. Lavy (2008) utilized a natural experiment of blinded versus non-blinded grading and found an anti-male bias in each subject<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047272708000418?via%3Dihub</ref>. Schuster et al. (2021) found no net effect but there were biases in the opposite direction of gender stereotypes for individual subjects, such that they rated girls better on a math test and boys better on a German test<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11218-021-09633-y#Sec39</ref>. The existence of a gender bias in grading appears to be heterogeneous between studies and there appears to be no evidence that to the extent that it exists, it goes one way against a particular sex.

Female education reduces fertility<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X14001697</ref><ref>https://blogs.worldbank.org/health/female-education-and-childbearing-closer-look-data</ref><ref>https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2637960</ref><ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-016-9357-6</ref>.

Boys tend to have a relative strength in technical/numerical subjects and girls tend to have a relative strength in verbal/language ones. Boys and girls largely pursued careers cognitively matching their initial academic strengths, although men and women matched on these strengths made different career choices. In particular, women with technical/numerical strengths largely avoided careers demanding these skills<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289617302167</ref>.

### Criminal Justice: Pro-Female Bias

All else equal, men are more likely to be arrested, are more aggressively policed on average than women, and are more likely to have force initiated on them. Some of these results when tested have been found to be robust to publication bias, and these results are consistently found in a variety of studies. Women appear to be held to much lower standards by police in a variety of circumstances<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047235214000890</ref><ref>http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.848.1523&rep=rep1&type=pdf</ref><ref>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07418820400095741</ref><ref>https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Volkan-Topalli/publication/247744878_The_Impact_of_Implicit_Stereotyping_on_Offender_ProfilingUnexpected_Results_From_an_Observational_Study_of_Shoplifting/links/00b49534d42678e6fd000000/The-Impact-of-Implicit-Stereotyping-on-Offender-ProfilingUnexpected-Results-From-an-Observational-Study-of-Shoplifting.pdf</ref><ref>https://domesticviolenceresearch.org/pdf/PASK.Tables12.Revised.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047235204000637?via%3Dihub</ref><ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12103-014-9278-y</ref><ref>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07418820701485601</ref>.

Sentencing judgements and related court activities, such as the death penalty, all appear to favor women over men even when controlling for relevant factors. This holds for all kinds of crimes, including murder, sexual offenses, drug offenses, and more. These effects are much more consistent than racial effects in sentencing. Cases involving a female victim are more likely to result in a harsher sentence, and this effect is especially bad when the defendant is male<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1559-1816.1994.tb01552.x</ref><ref>https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/35464079.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047235215000665</ref><ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0011128703256265</ref><ref>https://scholarworks.utep.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&context=gang_lee</ref><ref>https://files.deathpenaltyinfo.org/legacy/files/pdf/FemDeathDec2005.pdf</ref><ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10940-019-09416-x</ref><ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/sp.2004.51.2.222?seq=1</ref><ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/088740349900900305</ref><ref>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07418829500092601#:~:text=Sex%20effects%20and%20sentencing:%20An%20analysis%20of%20the,composition,%20and%20to%20conceptual%20dimensions%20of%20the%20research</ref><ref>https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1767508</ref>.

### Healthcare: Anti-Female Bias

There exists a gender bias in research<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1761670/</ref>. Research funding disproportionately goes into dealing with male medical issues. Early clinical trials until 1994 mostly excluded women for safety reasons which led to it being reported in 2005 that eight out of ten prescription drugs were withdrawn from the US market because of women's health issues. Women more recently have not been recruited much into trial results, in part because women using hormonal contraception must be considered a separate analytical group, a study requirement which creates access burdens for women. Researchers and ethics committees ignored risks of contraceptives, interference with drug metabolism by hormonal contraception, that partners may be sterile, that fetal harm may also affect men, that the risk of fetal exposure to one dose of a drug was minimal and that women could make their own decisions. There is also a lack of incorporation of gender data into evidence-based medicine, with often a lack of gender specific management guidelines.

#### Mental Illness

Strong genetic selection exists against schizophrenia, autism, and anorexia nervosa<ref>Power, R. A., Kyaga, S., Uher, R., MacCabe, J. H., Långström, N., Landen, M., McGuffin, P., Lewis, C.

JAMA Psychiatry, 70(1), 22. https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2013.268</ref>, and there appears to be genetic selection for ADHD<ref>Rokeach, A., & Wiener, J. (2014).

Tinder users tend to be higher on dark triad traits and sociosexuality, and those with higher dark triad traits and sociosexuality are more motivated to use Tinder for short-term mating<ref>Sevi, B. (2019). The dark side of Tinder. Journal of Individual Differences, 40(4), 242–246. https://doi.org/10.1027/1614-0001/a000297</ref>.

McDonald et al. (2012) found that there are two distinct factors of dark triad life history strategies. First is a fast life strategy factor that includes the impulsive antisociality facet of psychopathy, the entitlement/exploitativeness facet of narcissism, machiavellianism, unrestricted sociosexuality, and aggression. Second is a slow life strategy factor that includes the fearless dominance facet of psychopathy and the leadership/authority and grandiose exhibitionism facets of narcissism<ref>McDonald, M. M., Donnellan, M. B., & Navarrete, C. D. (2012). A life history approach to understanding the Dark Triad. Personality and Individual Differences, 52(5), 601–605. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2011.12.003</ref>.

Davis et al. (2018) found that narcissism predicted a slow strategy, while psychopathy and status-driven risk taking predicted a fast strategy. Machiavellianism and everyday sadism were not predictors of life history strategy<ref>Davis, A. C., Visser, B. A., Volk, A. A., Vaillancourt, T., & Arnocky, S. (2018).

Dark triad personalities are significantly more attractive to women<ref>The Dark Triad personality: Attractiveness to women. (n.d.). ResearchGate. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273809664_The_Dark_Triad_personality_Attractiveness_to_women</ref>.

Personality factors most strongly linked to susceptibility to infidelity are low Conscientiousness, high Narcissism, and high Psychoticism<ref>Buss, D. M., & Shackelford, T. K. (1997). Susceptibility to infidelity in the first year of marriage. Journal of Research in Personality, 31(2), 193–221. https://doi.org/10.1006/jrpe.1997.2175</ref>.

#### Intelligence and Personality

Individuals at the upper and lower ends of the intelligence distribution are less likely to have sex<ref>Halpern, C. T., Joyner, K., Udry, J., & Suchindran, C. (2000). Smart teens don’t have sex (or kiss much either). Journal of Adolescent Health, 26(3), 213–225. https://doi.org/10.1016/s1054-139x(99)00061-0</ref>.

The only personality trait that affects physical attractiveness is extraversion, which has a positive effect<ref>Anderson, C., John, O. P., Keltner, D., & Kring, A. M. (2001). Who attains social status? Effects of personality and physical attractiveness in social groups.

#### Bullying

Intrasexual competition comprises both competitor derogation and self-promotion. Bullying can be seen as a form of intrasexual competition in that it involves competitor derogation. This is consistent with evidence suggesting that male and female adolescent bullies are engaging in or cognizing about self-promotion strategies to improve physical appearance as well. Bullied adolescents are also concerned with appearance but mostly due to reduced self-esteem, body-esteem, and emotional problems from getting bullied<ref>Adolescent bullying and intrasexual competition : body concerns and self-promotion tactics amongst bullies, victims and bully-victims.  - WRAP: Warwick Research Archive Portal.

Male status has a positive effect on reproductive success<ref>Von Rueden, C. R., & Jaeggi, A. V. (2016). Men’s status and reproductive success in 33 nonindustrial societies: Effects of subsistence, marriage system, and reproductive strategy. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 113(39), 10824–10829. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1606800113</ref>. However, only high status men and not high status women are seen as more attractive<ref>Dewall, C. N., & Maner, J. K. (2008). High status men (but not women) capture the eye of the beholder.

High-income men have more biological children than do low-income men and high-income women. However, intelligence decreases the number of offspring and frequency of sex for both men and women<ref>Hopcroft, R. L. (2006).

Greater income does not buy more sex, nor more sexual partners<ref>Blanchflower, D. G., & Oswald, A. J. (2004, May 24). Money, Sex, and Happiness: An Empirical study. NBER. https://web.archive.org/web/20170109063039/https://www.nber.org/papers/w10499</ref>. However, while men tend not to care about income in online dating, women do<ref>Ong, D., & Wang, J. (2015).

### Physical Factors

#### Health

Physiological measures of health such as immune function, oxidative stress and semen quality do not appear to be strongly related to mating success<ref>Foo, Y. Z., Simmons, L. W., & Rhodes, G. (2017). The relationship between health and mating success in humans. Royal Society Open Science, 4(1), 160603. https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.160603</ref>. Only female waist-to-hip ratio and weight appear to predict both attractiveness and health. Attractiveness has an overall relationship with health among women, but male attractiveness does not appear to be related to male health<ref>Wayback machine. (n.d.). https://web.archive.org/web/20140905115735/https://femininebeauty.info/f/weeden.sabini.pdf</ref>.

#### Shoulder-Hip-Waist Ratios

Men with higher shoulder to hip ratios and women with low waist to hip ratios have sexual intercourse at an earlier age, more sexual partners, more extrapair copulations, and having themselves been extrapair copulation partners<ref>Hughes, S. M., & Gallup, G. G. (2003). Sex differences in morphological predictors of sexual behavior. Evolution and Human Behavior, 24(3), 173–178. https://doi.org/10.1016/s1090-5138(02)00149-6</ref>. A low waist-hip ratio is viewed cross-culturally as attractive<ref>Singh, D., Dixson, B., Jessop, T., Morgan, B., & Dixson, A. (2010). Cross-cultural consensus for waist–hip ratio and women’s attractiveness. Evolution and Human Behavior, 31(3), 176–181. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2009.09.001</ref>. Even blind men prefer a low waist-top-hip ratio<ref>Karremans, J. C., Frankenhuis, W. E., & Arons, S. (2010). Blind men prefer a low waist-to-hip ratio. Evolution and Human Behavior, 31(3), 182–186. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2009.10.001</ref>.

#### Facial Morphology

Facial width-to-height ratio is positively associated with aggression<ref>Haselhuhn, M. P., Ormiston, M. E., & Wong, E. M. (2015). Men’s facial Width-to-Height ratio Predicts Aggression: A Meta-Analysis. PLoS ONE, 10(4), e0122637. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0122637</ref>, psychopathic traits<ref>Anderl, C., Hahn, T., Schmidt, A., Moldenhauer, H., Notebaert, K., Clément, C. C., & Windmann, S. (2016). Facial width-to-height ratio predicts psychopathic traits in males. Personality and Individual Differences, 88, 99–101. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2015.08.057</ref>, and achievement drive<ref>Lewis, G., Lefevre, C., & Bates, T. (2012). Facial width-to-height ratio predicts achievement drive in US presidents. Personality and Individual Differences, 52(7), 855–857. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2011.12.030</ref>. Those with a higher facial width-to-height ratio tend to achieve higher social status<ref>Hahn, T., Winter, N. R., Anderl, C., Notebaert, K., Wuttke, A. M., Clément, C. C., & Windmann, S. (2017). Facial width-to-height ratio differs by social rank across organizations, countries, and value systems. PLoS ONE, 12(11), e0187957. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0187957</ref>.

Facial width was also related to attractiveness to women for short-term but not long-term relationships<ref>Valentine, K. A., Li, N. P., Singapore Management University, Georg August University Göttingen, University of St Andrews, Valentine, K. A., Li, N. P., Penke, L., & Perrett, D. I. (2014). Judging a Man by the Width of his Face: The Role of Facial Ratios and Dominance in Mate Choice at Speed-Dating Events. Psychological Science, 25–3, 806–811. https://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2727&context=soss_research</ref>. Facially dominant looking boys are more likely to report coital opportunity than facially submissive looking boys<ref>Mazur, A., Halpern, C., & Udry, J. (1994). Dominant looking male teenagers copulate earlier. Ethology and Sociobiology, 15(2), 87–94. https://doi.org/10.1016/0162-3095(94)90019-1</ref>.

#### Body Attractiveness

Upper body strength is the primary determinant of male body attractiveness, along with tallness and leanness<ref>Sell, A., Lukazsweski, A. W., & Townsley, M. (2017). Cues of upper body strength account for most of the variance in men’s bodily attractiveness. Proceedings of the Royal Society B Biological Sciences, 284(1869), 20171819. https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2017.1819</ref>. Across cultures, there is an inverse linear relationship between physically attractiveness and body fatness or BMI<ref>Wang, G., Djafarian, K., Egedigwe, C. A., Hamdouchi, A. E., Ojiambo, R., Ramuth, H., Wallner-Liebmann, S. J., Lackner, S., Diouf, A., Sauciuvenaite, J., Hambly, C., Vaanholt, L. M., Faries, M. D., & Speakman, J. R. (2015). The relationship of female physical attractiveness to body fatness. PeerJ, 3, e1155. https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.1155</ref>.

#### Height

There is a strong inverse association between height and suicide<ref>Magnusson, P. K. E., Gunnell, D., Tynelius, P., Smith, G. D., & Rasmussen, F. (2005). Strong inverse association between height and suicide in a large cohort of Swedish men: evidence of early life origins of suicidal behavior? American Journal of Psychiatry, 162(7), 1373–1375. https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.162.7.1373</ref>.

Male tallness is directionally selected for<ref>Mueller, U., & Mazur, A. (2001). Evidence of unconstrained directional selection for male tallness. Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 50(4), 302–311. https://doi.org/10.1007/s002650100370</ref>. Women prefer on average a larger height difference between themselves and their partner than men do. Women are most satisfied when their partner is 21 cm taller, while men are most satisfied when they are 8cm taller than their partner<ref>Stulp, G., Buunk, A. P., & Pollet, T. V. (2013). Women want taller men more than men want shorter women. Personality and Individual Differences, 54(8), 877–883. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2012.12.019</ref>.

Height in men is negatively associated with intrasexual competitiveness<ref>Polo, P., Fernandez, A., Muñoz-Reyes, J. A., Dufey, M., & Buunk, A. P. (2018). Intrasexual competition and height in adolescents and adults. Evolutionary Psychology, 16(1), 147470491774917. https://doi.org/10.1177/1474704917749172</ref>. Intrasexual competition is positively correlated with height over-report<ref>Mailhos, A., Buunk, A. P., & Del Arca, D. (2017). High intrasexual competition is related to inflated height reports in male junior soccer players. Personality and Individual Differences, 113, 229–234. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2017.03.030</ref>.

Short children are more likely to be bullied than their taller peers<ref>Bullying in school: are short pupils at risk? Questionnaire study in a cohort. (2000). In BMJ (Vol. 320, Issue 4, pp. 612–613). https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC32258/pdf/612.pdf</ref>.

#### Voice Pitch

Individuals with lower-pitched voices are more likely to win elected office but are not actually better leaders<ref>Klofstad, C. A., & Anderson, R. C. (2018). Voice pitch predicts electability, but does not signal leadership ability. Evolution and Human Behavior, 39(3), 349–354. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2018.02.007</ref>. CEOs with deeper voices manage larger companies and thus make more money<ref>Mayew, W. J., Parsons, C. A., & Venkatachalam, M. (2013). Voice pitch and the labor market success of male chief executive officers. Evolution and Human Behavior, 34(4), 243–248. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2013.03.001</ref>. Lower-pitched voices are perceived by women to be more attractive and to signify a higher socioeconomic status<ref>O’Connor, J. J., Fraccaro, P. J., Pisanski, K., Tigue, C. C., O’Donnell, T. J., & Feinberg, D. R. (2014). Social dialect and men’s voice pitch influence women’s mate preferences. Evolution and Human Behavior, 35(5), 368–375. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2014.05.001</ref>. Low male voice pitch is preferred mainly in short-term mating contexts rather than in long-term committed ones, and this is greatest when women are in the fertile phase of their ovulatory cycles. Lower male voice pitch correlated with higher self-reported mating success<ref>Puts, D. A. (2005). Mating context and menstrual phase affect women’s preferences for male voice pitch. Evolution and Human Behavior, 26(5), 388–397. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2005.03.001</ref>. Lower voice pitch being preferred mainly in short-term mating contexts is mediated by the relation between voice pitch and perceived infidelity by females<ref>O’Connor, J. J., Pisanski, K., Tigue, C. C., Fraccaro, P. J., & Feinberg, D. R. (2014). Perceptions of infidelity risk predict women’s preferences for low male voice pitch in short-term over long-term relationship contexts. Personality and Individual Differences, 56, 73–77. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2013.08.029</ref>. While male voice pitch but not female voice pitch is related to reproductive outcomes, voice pitch in men does not predict child morality<ref>Apicella, C., Feinberg, & Marlowe, F. (2007). Voice pitch predicts reproductive success in male hunter-gatherers. Biology Letters, 3(6), 682–684. https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2007.0410</ref>.

#### Facial Shape

Across cultures, facial averageness, symmetry, and sexual dimorphism are attractive in both male and female faces<ref>Rhodes, G. (2006). The Evolutionary Psychology of Facial Beauty. Annual Review of Psychology, 57(1), 199–226. https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.psych.57.102904.190208</ref>. This suggests that there exists some good candidates for biologically based standards of beauty.

### Sperm Count

Across North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand, there has been a 50-60% decline in sperm counts between 1973 and 2011<ref>Levine, H., Jørgensen, N., Martino-Andrade, A., Mendiola, J., Weksler-Derri, D., Mindlis, I., Pinotti, R., & Swan, S. H. (2017). Temporal trends in sperm count: a systematic review and meta-regression analysis. Human Reproduction Update, 23(6), 646–659. https://doi.org/10.1093/humupd/dmx022</ref>.

### Race

Men of all races tend to rate Asian women as being relatively attractive and black women as being relatively unattractive, although tend to also be biased in favor of their own race. Numbers are mixed for white women and latina women. Women tend to rate their own race as being the most attractive<ref>Rudder, C. (n.d.). Race and Attraction, 2009 – 2014. OkTrends. https://gwern.net/doc/psychology/okcupid/raceandattraction20092014.html</ref>.

Europeans living in countries with a large foreign-born population have an increased preference for minority groups<ref>Racial Preferences in Online Dating across European Countries. (n.d.). ResearchGate. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271837870_Racial_Preferences_in_Online_Dating_across_European_Countries</ref>.

### Beauty

There is interrater reliability in terms of who people find is and is not attractive both within and across cultures. Moreover, attractive children and adults are judged and treated more positively than unattractive children and adults, even by those who know them, and attractive children and adults exhibit more positive behaviors and traits<ref>Langlois, J. H., Kalakanis, L., Rubenstein, A. J., Larson, A., Hallam, M., & Smoot, M. (2000). Maxims or myths of beauty? A meta-analytic and theoretical review. Psychological Bulletin, 126(3), 390–423. https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.126.3.390</ref>. People assessed as more physically attractive at age 15 had higher socioeconomic status at age 36 and were more likely to be married, even after controlling for other factors<ref>Benzeval, M., Green, M. J., & Macintyre, S. (2013). Does Perceived Physical Attractiveness in Adolescence Predict Better Socioeconomic Position in Adulthood? Evidence from 20 Years of Follow Up in a Population Cohort Study. PLoS ONE, 8(5), e63975. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0063975</ref>.

### Asking Out

Men tend to prefer to ask out women and ask out women more. On the other hand, women tend to prefer to be asked out and ask out men less. This has not changed in spite of great changes in gender relations over the past few decades. This may be because women evolutionarily want to demonstrate sexual fidelity to attract an ideal partner<ref>Mills, M., PhD. (2024, June 17). Despite greater equality, women still don’t ask. Why? Psychology Today. https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-how-and-why-of-sex-differences/201104/why-dont-women-ask-men-out-on-first-dates</ref>.

### Creepiness and Sexual Harassment

Men are perceived as being more creepy than women and women are more likely to associate sexual threat with creepiness. Unusual nonverbal behavior and unpredictability were also predictors of creepiness. This is consistent with the hypothesis that being creeped out is an evolved adaptive emotional response<ref>McAndrew, F. T., & Koehnke, S. S. (2016). On the nature of creepiness. New Ideas in Psychology, 43, 10–15. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.newideapsych.2016.03.003</ref>.

Attractiveness and high social status are predictive of tolerance for sexual harassment<ref>Wuensch, K. L., & Moore, C. H. (2004). Effects of physical attractiveness on evaluations of a male employee’s allegation of sexual harassment by his female employer. The Journal of Social Psychology, 144(2), 207–217. https://doi.org/10.3200/socp.144.2.207-217</ref><ref>Angelone, D. J., Mitchell, D., & Carola, K. (2008). Tolerance of Sexual Harassment: a laboratory paradigm. Archives of Sexual Behavior, 38(6), 949–958. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-008-9421-2</ref>.

### Sexuality

#### Monogamy/Promiscuity

Having multiple sex partners is not related to increased anxiety or depression but is related to alcohol and drug dependence issues<ref>Abpp, S. K. W. P. (2024, May 24). Less may be more. Psychology Today. https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/fulfillment-at-any-age/201304/the-long-term-psychological-effects-of-having-multiple-sex</ref>.

Across cultures, women tend to suppress female sexuality much more than men. This is because women sex is a limited resource that women use to negotiate with men, and scarcity gives women an advantage<ref>Baumeister, R. F., & Twenge, J. M. (2002). Cultural suppression of female sexuality. Review of General Psychology, 6(2), 166–203. https://doi.org/10.1037/1089-2680.6.2.166</ref>.

Men who transition into monogamous behavior, a less competitive mode of sexual behavior, reduce their risk of violence<ref>Seffrin, P. M. (2016). The Competition–Violence Hypothesis: Sex, marriage, and Male Aggression. Justice Quarterly, 34(4), 652–673. https://doi.org/10.1080/07418825.2016.1216153</ref>.

The number of sexual partners individuals had in their lifetimes was associated with lower levels of sexual quality, communication, and relationship stability<ref>Sci-Hub | Sowing wild oats: Valuable experience or a field full of weeds? | 10.1111/pere.12009. (n.d.). https://sci-hub.usualwant.com/10.1111/pere.12009</ref>.

People with more premarital sex partners tend to have higher divorse rates<ref>Counterintuitive trends in the link between premarital sex and marita. . . (2018, May 4). archive.ph. https://archive.ph/Mj4eo</ref>.

Sexual and emotional infidelity are related to sexual and emotional promiscuity<ref>Pinto, R., & Arantes, J. (2017). The Relationship between Sexual and Emotional Promiscuity and Infidelity. Athens Journal of Social Sciences, 4(4), 385–398. https://doi.org/10.30958/ajss.4-4-3</ref>.

Across cultures, women's virginity is viewed as a gift and women are viewed as sexually submissive to men. On the other hand, male virginity was seen as a failure to men's masculinity<ref>Tejada, A. M. & Humboldt State University. (2020). Like a Virgin: Comparing Cross-Cultural Virginity. In Communication Senior Capstones [Thesis]. https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1008&context=senior_comm</ref>.

#### Sex Drive/Sociosexuality

Men tend to have a higher sex drive and greater sociosexuality than women across countries<ref>Baumeister, R., Catanese, K. R., & Vohs, K. (2001). Is there a gender difference in strength of sex drive? theoretical views, conceptual distinctions, and a review of relevant evidence. https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Is-There-a-Gender-Difference-in-Strength-of-Sex-and-Baumeister-Catanese/5f8446340d4ed375007351539e7993fa44e2e31b?p2df</ref><ref>Lippa, R. A. (2007). Sex Differences in Sex Drive, Sociosexuality, and Height across 53 Nations: Testing Evolutionary and Social Structural Theories. Archives of Sexual Behavior, 38(5), 631–651. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-007-9242-8</ref>. The evidence on sociosexuality consistent with a hybrid model in which both biological and social structural influences contribute to sex differences, while sex drive is consistent with a biological model.

#### Virginity

Female adolescents who had sex had significant decreases in peer acceptance over time, while male adolescents who had sex had significant increases in peer acceptance. Interestingly however, findings for making out suggested that female adolescents had increases in peer acceptance and male adolescents had decreases in peer acceptance<ref>Kreager, D. A., Staff, J., Gauthier, R., Lefkowitz, E. S., & Feinberg, M. E. (2016). The double standard at sexual debut: gender, sexual behavior and adolescent peer acceptance. Sex Roles, 75(7–8), 377–392. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11199-016-0618-x</ref>.

#### Sexual Activity

Penile-vaginal intercourse is associated with a wide range of better psychological and physiological health indices. Other activities have weaker, null, or inverse associations with health indices<ref>Brody, S. (2010). The relative health benefits of different sexual activities. The Journal of Sexual Medicine, 7(4_Part_1), 1336–1361. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1743-6109.2009.01677.x</ref>.

### Other Attractiveness

Physical attractiveness and race are the strongest predictors of decisions in a swiping experiment<ref>Chopik, W. J., & Johnson, D. J. (2021). Modeling dating decisions in a mock swiping paradigm: An examination of participant and target characteristics. Journal of Research in Personality, 92, 104076. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrp.2021.104076</ref>.

For men, being unattractive decreases the likelihood of finding a partner or finding a partner of a higher educational level, but not for women<ref>Wayback machine. (n.d.). https://web.archive.org/web/20170824000252/https://reis.cis.es//REIS/PDF/REIS_159_07_ENGLISH1499424514902.pdf</ref>.

Identical twins have more similar preferences for traits such as height, skin color, hair color and length, chest hair, facial hair, and breast size, suggesting genetic effects. Heritability estimates range from zero to 57%<ref>Evidence for genetic variation in human mate preferences for sexually dimorphic physical traits. (n.d.). ResearchGate. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233725541_Evidence_for_Genetic_Variation_in_Human_Mate_Preferences_for_Sexually_Dimorphic_Physical_Traits</ref>.

There is a robust association between physical attractiveness and various measures of health. This suggests that physical attractiveness is a phenotypic marker for health<ref>Nedelec, J. L., & Beaver, K. M. (2014). Physical attractiveness as a phenotypic marker of health: an assessment using a nationally representative sample of American adults. Evolution and Human Behavior, 35(6), 456–463. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2014.06.004</ref>.

Those who are physically more attractive tend to be more optimistic and have higher social mobility<ref>Urbatsch, R. (2018). Things are looking up: Physical beauty, social mobility, and optimistic dispositions. Social Science Research, 71, 19–36. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2018.01.006</ref>.

Physically attractive people are perceived as more sociable, dominant, sexually warm, mentally healthy, intelligent, and socially skilled. However, relationships between physical attractiveness and personality or mental ability are generally trivial, although good-looking people were less lonely, less socially anxious, more popular, more socially skilled, and more sexually experienced. Self-ratings of physical attractiveness are positively correlated with more attributes than actual physical attractiveness<ref>Feingold, A. (1992). Good-looking people are not what we think. https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Good-looking-people-are-not-what-we-think.-Feingold/7a30a68c4d9534e12231a7ac95fe86c867c77566</ref>.

More attractive people are less likely to be arrested and convicted<ref>Beaver, K. M., Boccio, C., Smith, S., & Ferguson, C. J. (2019). Physical attractiveness and criminal justice processing: results from a longitudinal sample of youth and young adults. Psychiatry Psychology and Law, 26(4), 669–681. https://doi.org/10.1080/13218719.2019.1618750</ref>.

Physically attractive workers are more confident, have better oral skills, and are independently considered more able by employers, increasing their wages<ref>Mobius, M. M., & Rosenblat, T. S. (2006). Why beauty matters. American Economic Review, 96–1, 222–235. https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3043406/mobius_beauty.pdf?s</ref>.

### Relationships

#### Loneliness and Rejection

Social rejection is reflected in the part of the brain that experiences physical pain, suggesting that experiencing rejection is neurologically analogous to experiencing physical pain<ref>Kross, E., Berman, M. G., Mischel, W., Smith, E. E., & Wager, T. D. (2011). Social rejection shares somatosensory representations with physical pain. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 108(15), 6270–6275. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1102693108</ref>. Greater social connection is associated with a reduced risk of early death. Social isolation and loneliness significantly increase premature mortality<ref>Holt-Lunstad, J., Smith, T. B., & Layton, J. B. (2010). Social Relationships and Mortality Risk: A Meta-analytic review. PLoS Medicine, 7(7), e1000316. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000316</ref><ref>So lonely I could die. (2017, August 5). https://www.apa.org. https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2017/08/lonely-die</ref>.

Subjective well-being is associated with higher productivity and improved country economic performance<ref>DiMaria, C. H., Peroni, C., & Sarracino, F. (2019). Happiness Matters: Productivity Gains from Subjective Well-Being. Journal of Happiness Studies, 21(1), 139–160. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10902-019-00074-1</ref>.

Individuals who have poor mating performance experience more negative emotions, fewer positive emotions, and are less satisfied with their lives<ref>Apostolou, M., Shialos, M., & Georgiadou, P. (2019). The emotional cost of poor mating performance. Personality and Individual Differences, 138, 188–192. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2018.10.003</ref>. In fact, even viewing pictures of a romantic partner reduces experimental pain<ref>Younger, J., Aron, A., Parke, S., Chatterjee, N., & Mackey, S. (2010). Viewing pictures of a romantic partner reduces experimental pain: involvement of neural reward systems. PLoS ONE, 5(10), e13309. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0013309</ref>.

Warm partner contact is related to lower cardiovascular reactivity, suggesting that affectionate relationships with a partner may contribute to someone being less reactive to stressful life events<ref>Grewen, K. M., Anderson, B. J., Girdler, S. S., & Light, K. C. (2003). Warm partner contact is related to lower cardiovascular reactivity. Behavioral Medicine, 29(3), 123–130. https://doi.org/10.1080/08964280309596065</ref>.

#### Single Motherhood

The less time fathers spend with their children,, the more conduct problems their children had, but only if fathers did not engage in antisocial behavior. If they are high in anti-social behavior, time spent with their children increases the conduct problems of their children<ref>Jaffee, S. R., Moffitt, T. E., Caspi, A., & Taylor, A. (2003). Life with (or without) father: The benefits of living with two biological parents depend on the father’s antisocial behavior. Child Development, 74(1), 109–126. https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-8624.t01-1-00524</ref>.

#### Marriage and Divorce

There is a positive relationship between premarital sex and risk of divorse. This is not a direct causal effect, but rather due to prior unobserved differences such as the willingness to break traditional norms<ref>Kahn, J. R., & London, K. A. (1991). Premarital sex and the risk of divorce. Journal of Marriage and Family, 53(4), 845. https://doi.org/10.2307/352992</ref>.

Premarital cohabitation is negatively related to marital happiness and positively related to conflict<ref>James, S. L., & Beattie, B. A. (2012). Reassessing the Link between Women’s Premarital Cohabitation and Marital Quality. Social Forces, 91(2), 635–662. https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/sos126</ref>.

Women are more likely to initiate divorce than men, but men and women are equally likely to initiate a breakup of a non-marriage relationship<ref>LaBier, D., PhD. (2021, March 11). Wives report more dissatisfaction with their marriages than their husbands. Psychology Today. https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-new-resilience/201508/women-initiate-divorce-much-more-men-heres-why</ref>. It is hypothesized that the difference in marriage is due to women being more likely to express overt conflict and dissatisfaction about the state of the marriage, while the man is more likely to feel troubled but fine with the way things are. On the other hand, with non-marital but committed relationships which are often composed of younger people, the relationships tend to be formed in a more egalitarian manner which means that both people are equally likely to address any conflicts that occur.

### Politics and Sexuality

Attractive candidates tend to get more votes. Politically unpopular parties tend to be represented by physically unattractive candidates<ref>Voters vote beautiful: The effect of physical appearance on a national election. (n.d.). ResearchGate. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232586298_Voters_Vote_Beautiful_The_Effect_of_Physical_Appearance_on_a_National_Election</ref>.

Conservatives are less likely to use a short-term mating strategy that is distinctive from their long-term strategy<ref>Muggleton, N. K., & Fincher, C. L. (2018). You’re not my type: Do conservatives have a bias for seeing long-term mates? Evolution and Human Behavior, 39(6), 652–663. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2018.06.009</ref>.

Even after controlling for socioeconomic status, more attractive individuals are more likely to report higher levels of political efficacy, identify as conservative, and identify as Republican<ref>Peterson, R. D., & Palmer, C. L. (2017). Effects of physical attractiveness on political beliefs. Politics and the Life Sciences, 36(2), 3–16. https://doi.org/10.1017/pls.2017.18</ref>.

Price et al. (2017) found that sociopolitical egalitarianism is negatively related to bodily formidability but is unrelated to other measures of facial formidability or attractiveness<ref>Price, M. E., Sheehy-Skeffington, J., Sidnaius, J., & Pound, N. (2017). Is sociopolitical egalitarianism related to bodily and facial formidability in men? Evolution and Human Behavior, 38(5), 626–634. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2017.04.001</ref>.

Both self-rated attractiveness and attractiveness rated by other people predict the endorsement of a belief in a just world and are related to a person's level of life satisfaction<ref>Westfall, R. S., Millar, M. G., & Lovitt, A. (2018). The influence of physical attractiveness on belief in a just world. Psychological Reports, 122(2), 536–549. https://doi.org/10.1177/0033294118763172</ref>.

### Sexism

Women tend to approve of benevolent sexist men but disapprove of hostile sexist men<ref>Wanting it both ways: Do women approve of benevolent sexism? (n.d.). ResearchGate. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251261112_Wanting_It_Both_Ways_Do_Women_Approve_of_Benevolent_Sexism</ref>. Women tend to also prefer men with benevolent sexist attitudes over those without them, despite also perceiving them as patronizing and undermining<ref>Bohner, G., Ahlborn, K., & Steiner, R. (2009). How Sexy are Sexist Men? Women’s Perception of Male Response Profiles in the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory. Sex Roles, 62(7–8), 568–582. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11199-009-9665-x</ref><ref>Gul, P., & Kupfer, T. R. (2018). Benevolent sexism and mate preferences: Why do women prefer benevolent men despite recognizing that they can be undermining? Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 45(1), 146–161. https://doi.org/10.1177/0146167218781000</ref>. Benevolent sexism in women is associated with greater preferences for high-resource partners, while hostile sexism in men is associated with stronger preferences for physically attractive partners. This along with other evidence suggests that women's desire for high-resource partners is related to a protection and security-provision motive, while men's desire for attractive partners is related to a dominance-based status-marker motive<ref>Sibley, C. G., & Overall, N. C. (2011). A dual process motivational model of ambivalent sexism and gender differences in romantic partner preferences. Psychology of Women Quarterly, 35(2), 303–317. https://doi.org/10.1177/0361684311401838</ref>.

Women's sex role ideology, but not men's, is negatively related to marital happiness and stability, with nontraditional women being less happy and more likely to be separated or divorced<ref>Lueptow, L. B., Guss, M. B., & Hyden, C. (1989). Sex role ideology, marital status, and happiness. Journal of Family Issues, 10(3), 383–400. https://doi.org/10.1177/019251389010003005</ref>.

### Criminality

Typical perpetrators of mass killings are low- or mid-status men with relatively low educational attainment and in a history of relationship problems. The trigger in most cases of these is a status loss or threat. This suggests that autogenic murderous rampages, although clearly psychopathological, may be rooted in a biological male desire to defend status<ref>Autogenic massacre as a maladaptive response to status threat. (n.d.). ResearchGate. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233146324_Autogenic_massacre_as_a_maladaptive_response_to_status_threat</ref>.

### Biorealism

#### Life History

Women who engage in short-term mating in the form of extra-pair liaisons tend to do so to acquire a better mate and to accrue immediate resources<ref>Greiling, H., & Buss, D. M. (2000). Women’s sexual strategies: the hidden dimension of extra-pair mating. Personality and Individual Differences, 28(5), 929–963. https://doi.org/10.1016/s0191-8869(99)00151-8</ref>.

#### Sexual Selection

While in modern times, actual male fertility is uncorrelated with social status, social status is highly correlated with potential fertility as estimated from copulation frequency<ref>Pérusse, D. (1993). Cultural and reproductive success in industrial societies: Testing the relationship at the proximate and ultimate levels. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 16(2), 267–283. https://doi.org/10.1017/s0140525x00029939</ref>. This suggests that evolutionary explanations of human behavior are still relevant in modern societies.

## Abortion

### Fetal Consciousness and Pain Perception

Evidence Primarily suggests that the fetus does not display consciousness/pain reception until at least around 23-24 gestation weeks when the necessary parts for pain perception are established<ref>Lee, S. J., Ralston, H. J. P., Drey, E. A., Partridge, J. C., & Rosen, M. A. (2005). Fetal pain. JAMA, 294(8), 947. https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.294.8.947</ref><ref>Lagercrantz, H., & Changeux, J. (2009). The emergence of human consciousness: from fetal to neonatal life. Pediatric Research, 65(3), 255–260. https://doi.org/10.1203/pdr.0b013e3181973b0d</ref><ref>Lagercrantz, H. (2014). The emergence of consciousness: Science and ethics. Seminars in Fetal and Neonatal Medicine, 19(5), 300–305. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.siny.2014.08.003</ref>.

### Effects of Abortion Law

#### Abortion Rate

The evidence overall suggests that abortion restrictions reduce the incidence of abortion, although there is some research suggesting otherwise. Research which compares countries with different levels of abortion restrictions over a single period of time or over long periods of time suggest that abortion restrictions have no effect on the incidence of abortion<ref>Bearak, J., Popinchalk, A., Ganatra, B., Moller, A., Tunçalp, Ö., Beavin, C., Kwok, L., & Alkema, L. (2020). Unintended pregnancy and abortion by income, region, and the legal status of abortion: estimates from a comprehensive model for 1990–2019. The Lancet Global Health, 8(9), e1152–e1161. https://doi.org/10.1016/s2214-109x(20)30315-6</ref><ref>Singh, S., Remez, L., Sedgh, G., Kwok, L., Onda, T., & GUTTMACHER INSTITUTE. (n.d.). Uneven progress and unequal access. In J. Rosenberg, M. Moran, & K. Randall (Eds.), GUTTMACHER INSTITUTE. https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/report_pdf/abortion-worldwide-2017.pdf</ref>. The main problem with these is that they don’t longitudinally look at changes in laws, but rather hold the laws themselves constant, ultimately hiding many of the effects that such laws could have. When looking at studies which look at changes in abortion laws, research generally indicates that at least some abortion restrictions do result in lower rates of abortions<ref>Analyzing the effect of Anti-Abortion U.S. state legislation in the Post-Casey era. (n.d.). ResearchGate. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258188757_Analyzing_the_Effect_of_Anti-Abortion_US_State_Legislation_in_the_Post-Casey_Era</ref><ref>New, M. J. (2014).

There is variation in study results depending on what type of restriction is being examined, but changing the number of clinics in an area<ref>Jones, R. K., & Jerman, J. (2017). Abortion incidence and service availability in the United States, 2014. Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health, 49(1), 17–27. https://doi.org/10.1363/psrh.12015</ref><ref>Cunningham, S., Lindo, J.

Journal of Health Economics, 15(5), 513–553. https://doi.org/10.1016/s0167-6296(96)00494-8</ref><ref>Medoff, M. H. (2007). Price, restrictions and abortion demand. Journal of Family and Economic Issues, 28(4), 583–599. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10834-007-9080-9</ref>, and implementing parental consent requirements<ref>Cartoof, V. G., & Klerman, L. V. (1986). Parental consent for abortion: Impact of the Massachusetts Law. In American Journal of Public Health (Vol. 76, Issue 4, pp. 397–400) [Journal-article]. https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.76.4.397</ref><ref>Medoff, M. H. (2007). Price, restrictions and abortion demand. Journal of Family and Economic Issues, 28(4), 583–599. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10834-007-9080-9</ref>, all reduce the incidence of abortion. Additionally, Myers (2017) used difference-in-difference estimates to show that it was not increased access to the birth control pill which led to substantial changes in family formation<ref>Myers, C. K. (2017). The Power of Abortion Policy: Reexamining the effects of young women’s access to reproductive control. Journal of Political Economy, 125(6), 2178–2224. https://doi.org/10.1086/694293</ref>. Rather liberalized, access to abortion that allowed large numbers of women in the 1960s and 1970s to delay marriage and motherhood. All of this evidence taken together suggests that it is likely the case that a hard ban on abortion in any area would reduce the incidence of abortion.

#### Birth Rate

The evidence on the effects of abortion restrictions on the birth rate is fairly mixed, with some research suggesting that abortion restrictions increase birth rates<ref>Joyce, T., Kaestner, R., & Colman, S. (2006). Changes in abortions and births and the Texas Parental Notification law. New England Journal of Medicine, 354(10), 1031–1038. https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmsa054047</ref>, and other research suggesting abortion restrictions have no effect or even decrease birth rates due to decreased pregnancies<ref>Levine, P. B., Trainor, A. B., & Zimmerman, D. J. (1996). The effect of Medicaid abortion funding restrictions on abortions, pregnancies and births. Journal of Health Economics, 15(5), 555–578. https://doi.org/10.1016/s0167-6296(96)00495-x</ref>. This discrepancy, however, can be solved through considering the distinction between hard restrictions (banning vs legalizing) and soft restrictions. Changing from hard restrictions to liberal abortion laws appears to drastically reduce births, which suggests that the reverse would increase births. However, modest changes in restrictions appear to have no effect on births<ref>Abortion policy and fertility Outcomes: the Eastern European Experience. (2004). Dartmouth Scholarship. https://digitalcommons.dartmouth.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3361&context=facoa</ref>. Therefore, it appears that hard restrictions do increase birth rates, while soft restrictions may not.

#### Maternal Mortality

Research unanimously shows that bans on abortion lead to increases in maternal mortality, which are often very large<ref>Haddad, L. B., & Nour, N. M. (2009, January 1). Unsafe abortion: unnecessary maternal mortality. PubMed Central (PMC). https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2709326/</ref><ref>Benson, J., Andersen, K., & Samandari, G. (2011).

CU Boulder Today. https://www.colorado.edu/today/2021/09/08/study-banning-abortion-would-boost-maternal-mortality-double-digits</ref>. This also appears to be the case with simple restrictions on abortion<ref>Study finds higher maternal mortality rates in states with more abortion restrictions | Tulane School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine. (n.d.). https://sph.tulane.edu/study-finds-higher-maternal-mortality-rates-states-more-abortion-restrictions</ref>.

### When Life Begins

95% of biologists affirm that life begins at conception<ref>Jacobs, S. A. (2018). Biologists’ consensus on “When Life Begins.” SSRN Electronic Journal. https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3211703</ref>.

### Mental Health

Coleman (2011) did a meta-analysis on the effects of abortion on mental health and found that it increased the risk of mental health problems<ref>Coleman, P. K. (2011). Abortion and mental health: quantitative synthesis and analysis of research published 1995–2009. The British Journal of Psychiatry, 199(3), 180–186. https://doi.org/10.1192/bjp.bp.110.077230</ref>, but there have been numerous flaws which render the study invalid<ref>Steinberg, J. R., Trussell, J., Hall, K. S., & Guthrie, K. (2012). Fatal flaws in a recent meta-analysis on abortion and mental health. Contraception, 86(5), 430–437. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.contraception.2012.03.012</ref>. There appears to be a significant amount of conflicting research in the area<ref>Mental health and abortion: review and analysis. (1989, November 1).

### Abortion Law and Crime

There is conflicting research on whether abortion availability increases, decreases, or has no effect on crime<ref>7HG -R\H. (n.d.). RUNNING SCHEDULE. https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w8319/w8319.pdf</ref><ref>Lott, J. R., School of Law, Yale University, & School of Economics, University of Adelaide. (2001).

### Misc Abortion Policy

States that fund abortion have a significantly higher rate of abortions and significantly lower rates of teen pregnancy, low-birthweight babies, premature births, and births with late or no prenatal care<ref>Meier, K. J., & McFarlane, D. R. (1994). State family planning and abortion expenditures: Their effect on Public health. In Public Health (Vols. 84–84, Issue 9, pp. 1375–1384). https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdfplus/10.2105/AJPH.84.9.1468</ref>.

Abortion rates are slightly lower in states with medicaid funding restrictions on abortion, although there is no effect on birth rates<ref>Haas-Wilson, D. (1997). Women’s Reproductive Choices: The impact of Medicaid funding restrictions. Family Planning Perspectives, 29–29(5), 228–233. https://scholarworks.smith.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&context=eco_facpubs</ref>.

Stem cells can remain alive in human corpses for at least 17 days after death<ref>Choi, C. Q. (2012, June 12). Living stem cells discovered in 17-Day-Old human corpses. livescience.com. https://www.livescience.com/20897-living-stem-cells-discovered-human-corpse.html</ref>.

## Sex

### Fertility

Pronatalist policies are only modestly effective in increasing births<ref>https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=731766</ref><ref>https://wol.iza.org/articles/can-government-policies-reverse-undesirable-declines-in-fertility</ref>. Thus, pronatalist policies need to be combined with openness to increased immigration if they are to have any substantial effect on births. Socioeconomic factors in themselves such as job insecurity appear to only slightly affect fertility<ref>https://direct.mit.edu/rest/article-abstract/104/2/386/97750/A-Natural-Experiment-on-Job-Insecurity-and</ref>.

### Casual Sex

While people report more positive than negative emotional reactions about their most recent casual sex experience, they are associated with less positive emotional outcomes than sexual behavior in the context of romantic relationships. Moreover, longitudinal studies suggest that people who engage in casual sex have worse emotional health. This effect only appears to be short-run, however. Women tend to feel worse and have more negative emotional outcomes than men<ref>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224499.2020.1821163</ref>.

Higher sociosexuality moderates the effects of casual sex on well-being<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550614537308</ref>. In fact, positive sexuality has a positive impact on overall well-being<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23361205/</ref>. Being sexually satisfied is also associated with better emotional outcomes from casual sex<ref>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224499.2020.1821163</ref>. However, high sociosexuality is associated with increased probability of relationship dissolution through declines in marital satisfaction over time. This association is weakened with frequent sex, high sexual satisfaction, and low stress<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797619868997</ref>.

Women are significantly less likely to be receptive to sexual offers<ref>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J056v02n01_04</ref>.

Predictors of within-sex variation in casual sexual regret include worry about sexual reputation, experienced gratification during the encounter, and sociosexual orientation<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1474704916682903</ref>.

### Pornography

#### Mental Health Effects

Research suggests that there is a correlation between pornography consumption and anxiety, depression, and psychosomatic symptoms<ref>https://doi.org/10.1080/03009734.2018.1534907</ref><ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7835260/</ref><ref>https://doi.org/10.1097/NMD.0000000000001669</ref>. However, it is not clear whether this is due to pornography consumption increasing these things or if pornography consumption serves as a coping mechanism. Men who view pornography as immoral tend to have worse mental health when consuming it, but those who don't view pornography as immoral experience no negative mental health effects unless it is at a high frequency<ref>https://doi.org/10.1177/2156869317728373</ref>. Low scrupulosity buffers but does not get rid of the negative relationship between problematic pornography viewing and depression, anxiety, and stress<ref>https://doi.org/10.1080/10720162.2019.1567410</ref>. Perceived addiction to pornography is also related to psychological distress<ref>https://doi.org/10.1037/adb0000114</ref>.

#### Cognitive Effects

There is a negative association between pornography consumption and gray matter volume in various parts of the brain<ref>https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2014.93</ref><ref>https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Pornography%E2%80%99s-Effect-on-the-Brain%3A-A-Review-of-in-Muller/881c62a5bc147d5e8d34ffcbb7962e0c5d904263</ref>. Men with and without problematic pornography usage differed in their striatal responses to cues predicting erotic subjects but not for cues predicting monetary gains, suggesting that problematic pornography usage may represent a behavioral addiction<ref>https://doi.org/10.1038/npp.2017.78</ref>.

#### Relationship Effects

Pornography use is not related to the intrapersonal domains of body and self-satisfaction in relationships but is negatively related to the interpersonal domains of sexual and relational satisfaction<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/314197900_Pornography_Consumption_and_Satisfaction_A_Meta-Analysis_Pornography_and_Satisfaction</ref>. This appears to only affect men however.

Higher pornography consumption is linked with a greater chance of divorce<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20150614230353id_/http://www.marriottschool.net/emp/boyer/financeseminar/s11_12/Tyler%20Shumway%20F11.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319508811_Pornography_Use_and_Marital_Separation_Evidence_from_Two-Wave_Panel_Data#:~:text=Binary%20logistic%20regression%20analyses%20showed,as%20well%20as%20relevant%20sociodemographic</ref>.

Starting to watch pornography is associated for men and women with a significantly increased likelihood of divorce<ref>https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/829948</ref>.

Pornography use is either unassociated or negatively associated with nearly all relationship outcomes for married and unmarried Americans<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337991489_Pornography_and_Relationship_Quality_Establishing_the_Dominant_Pattern_by_Examining_Pornography_Use_and_31_Measures_of_Relationship_Quality_across_30_National_Surveys</ref>.

Adults who had watched pornographic films in the past year were more likely to be divorced, have had an extramarital affair, and report less marital and overall happiness<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10834-014-9391-6</ref>.

### Polygamy

Women in polygamous marriage have worsened mental health as compared with women in monogamous marriages<ref>https://files.catbox.moe/18e4px.pdf</ref>. Children with polygamous parents had significantly worse mental health than those with monogamous parents<ref>https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-021-04301-7</ref>.

The vast majority of human societies have permitted polygamous marriages, but normative monogamy has become the norm more recently. Through suppressing intrasexual competition it reduces crime rates, including rape, murder, assault, robbery and fraud, as well as decreasing personal abuses. Through reducing the competition for younger brides, normative monogamy reduces the spousal age gap, fertility, and gender inequality. It also increases savings, child investment, and economic productivity through shifting male efforts from seeking wives to paternal investment. Through increasing the relatedness within households normative monogamy also reduces intra-household conflict, leading to lower rates of child neglect, abuse, accidental death and homicide<ref>https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2011.0290</ref>.

Polygamy, through creating a social imbalance where a few economically well-off men marry many wives and many poor men marry late or never, results in more intergroup conflict<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022002719859636</ref>. Polygamy helps to partially explain sex differences in mortality rates in some nations due to the intensity of male mating competition<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/147470491000800205</ref>.

### Birth Control

Publicly funded family planning has been shown to generate significant cost savings for the government<ref>https://doi.org/10.2307/2135837</ref><ref>https://doi.org/10.1111/J.1475-6773.2007.00702.X</ref><ref>https://doi.org/10.1353/hpu.0.0060</ref><ref>https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2007.129353</ref>. For example, Foster et al. (2014) found that for every dollar spent on the family planning program it saved taxpayers $7.09. This was due to lower expenditures from STD testing and prevention of unplanned births<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-0009.12080</ref>.

### Sexual Education

Abstinence-only education does not appear to protect against pregnancy and STIs<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16387256/</ref>, and also contains scientifically inaccurate information on the issues of condom efficacy and gender stereotypes<ref>https://doi.org/10.1097/GCO.0b013e3282efdc0b</ref>. Moreover, abstinence-only interventions only have a very small overall effect on abstinent behavior<ref>https://doi.org/10.1093/HER/17.4.471</ref>. Abstinence-only programs have negative impacts on youth's willingness to use contraception to prevent negative sexual health outcomes related to sexual intercourse<ref>https://www.advocatesforyouth.org/wp-content/uploads/storage/advfy/documents/stateevaluations.pdf</ref>. Abstinence-only education is positively correlated with teenage pregnancy and birth rates compared to comprehensive sex education<ref>http://sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1054139X07004260?casa_token=mFeMFmZjXkMAAAAA:spyxC9wfLo0BY-CHKfH1QcR5ED_1spgDO41FrKxzK_0NEw3Bz11QXCA68xV_eiWH8nZlTc8</ref><ref>https://www.apha.org/policies-and-advocacy/public-health-policy-statements/policy-database/2015/01/23/09/37/sexuality-education-as-part-of-a-comprehensive-health-education-program-in-k-to-12-schools</ref>.

Comprehensive sex education appears to successfully delay sexual initiation<ref>https://doi.org/10.1097/GCO.0b013e3282efdc0b</ref>. Moreover, abstinence-only interventions only have a very small overall effect on abstinent behavior<ref>https://doi.org/10.1093/HER/17.4.471</ref><ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2818029/</ref>, as well as the development of healthy relationships, prevention of partner violence, prevention of child sex abuse, improved social/emotional learning, and increased media literacy<ref>https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(20)30456-0/fulltext</ref>. Teaching about contraception is not associated with increased risk of adolescent sexual activity or STDs<ref>http://sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1054139X07004260?casa_token=mFeMFmZjXkMAAAAA:spyxC9wfLo0BY-CHKfH1QcR5ED_1spgDO41FrKxzK_0NEw3Bz11QXCA68xV_eiWH8nZlTc8</ref>.

### Porn and Health

Those who use pornography have higher depressive symptoms, poorer quality of life, more mental- and physical-health-diminished days, and lower health status<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20946159/</ref>.

Higher pornography use is associated with body dissatisfaction, poor body appreciation, negative affect, and lower emotional bonding with partners<ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-04664-001</ref>.

### Porn and Violence

Pornography is related to sexual aggression, particularly verbal as opposed to physical aggression<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jcom.12201</ref>. However, as pornography availability increased, sex crimes either decreased or did not increase<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160252709000715</ref>.

### Porn and Actor Health

Porn actresses had more sexual partners, were more concerned about STDs, and enjoyed sex more. They also had higher levels of self-esteem, positive feelings, social support, sexual satisfaction, and spirituality. They were however more likely to have used drugs<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23167939/</ref>.

### Sex Work

Repressive policing of sex workers is associated with increased risk of sexual/physical violence from clients or other partners, also increasing risk of STIs for sex workers. It also disrupted sex workers' work environments, support networks, safety and risk reduction strategies, and access to health services and justice<ref>https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002680</ref>.

Decriminalization of prostitution, while increasing the size of the sex market, also led to a significant decline in reported rape offences<ref>https://conference.iza.org/conference_files/riskonomics2015/kastoryano_s6317.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/718952</ref>.

## Sexism

### Bias

#### Anti-Male Bias

Although men do tend to be seen as more favorable in terms of agency stereotyping<ref>https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/amp-amp0000494.pdf</ref>, attitudes and stereotypes either tend to be equal for men and women or favor women over men, with there being a larger female advantage in communion-related stereotyping and equality in competence<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167289154008?journalCode=pspc</ref><ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1471-6402.1991.tb00792.x</ref><ref>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00223989709603527</ref><ref>https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/amp-amp0000494.pdf</ref>.

Generally speaking it is only those gaps which favor men that are discussed. Disparities exist in various areas where men are disadvantaged, such as health and longevity, crime and violence, domestic relations, or education. Moreover, in the workplace, men are far more likely than women to be killed and to work long hours. These are ignored while gaps which disadvantage women are emphasized<ref>https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2311459</ref>. This has been shown in survey data where gender disparities in health, early education, and domestic roles are ignored<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103118304633?via%3Dihub</ref>. This asymmetry in support for social action towards change is predicted by beliefs about what the ideal gender representation should be and the perceived causes of gender imbalances in each career type. Importantly, gender representation in careers and not in salary appears to be the key factor underlying this discrepancy. This seems to imply a reinforcement of gender roles in the selective discussion of gender disparities, where women are expected to act like men in some ways, but men aren't expected to act like women. Another study which examines a similar area is Stewart-Williams & Thomas (2020), which finds that people react less positively to male-favoring differences than female-favoring differences, judging them as less important and less credible<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334751470_Reactions_to_Male-Favouring_vs_Female-Favouring_Sex_Differences_A_Preregistered_Experiment_and_Southeast_Asian_Replication</ref>. This suggests there is a protective fragility of women over men in terms of gender relations.

#### Media Representation

Research suggests that men in the media today are overwhelmingly portrayed as negative, being frequently associated with violence and aggression. With the exception of a small minority of positive media portrayals of male heroes such as war veterans, firefighters, and rescuers, and portrayals of men as good fathers, husbands, and citizens, the only males presented positively are men and boys who have been feminized<ref>https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057%2F9780230625679_7</ref>. Women's violence is more likely to be reported as irrational or emotional, while men's violence is more likely to be presented as normal or rational<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1468-2311.00200</ref>. Articles depicting men with mental illnesses are significantly more likely to have stigmatizing content and violence as themes. Articles depicting mentally ill women are significantly more likely to quote mental health experts, discuss mental health interventions, and have recovery and inadequate resources as themes<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00127-014-0902-4</ref>.

### Economics

#### Workplace

Over time, as women have increasingly entered high-status occupations, occupations' people-things orientation became an increasingly strong predictor of women's participation in occupations<ref>https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0095960</ref>. Men tend to show interest in more scientific occupations, while women tend to show interest in more social occupations<ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1934-01297-001</ref><ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27505283/</ref><ref>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21683603.2018.1521759</ref>. This is in part due to differences in sex hormones, which affect a person's things-people orientation<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3166361/</ref>.

Experimental research on hiring discrimination finds that there exists high levels of discrimination against men applying to female jobs<ref>https://ftp.iza.org/dp8584.pdf</ref>, which outweighs all other gender based discrimination effects<ref>https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0245513</ref>, with bias in male-dominated occupations being null<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282895214_Field_Experimental_Evidence_on_Gender_Discrimination_in_Hiring_Biased_as_Heckman_and_Siegelman_Predicted</ref><ref>https://academic.oup.com/esr/article/38/3/337/6412759?login=false</ref> or slightly in favor of males<ref>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03136-0</ref>.

Research suggests that gender quotas on the corporate boards of directors reduce company profitability and financial performance<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecaf.12487</ref>. While it is not clear what the causality is of this effect, this evidence suggests that at the very least gender quotas do not have a positive effect on company financial performance. Solal & Snellman. (2019) found that one additional woman on a board of directors for a company results in a 2.3% decrease in the company's market value on average<ref>https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/876846</ref>. This is argued to be because a company with a gender-diverse board of directors is interpreted by shareholders as revealing a preference for diversity over market performance, as opposed to more women actually harming the company. The perceptions of women in boards, as opposed to their actual performance in boards, determines the market value.

### Politics

Women perform just as well when they run for public office, but there is a gender gap in political ambition. This is due to a combination of women being less likely to be encouraged or recruited for office, and that public office careers have traits which women tend to find undesirable<ref>https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/05_women_lawless_fox.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.american.edu/spa/wpi/upload/2012-men-rule-report-web.pdf</ref>.

### Political Quotas

I am generally for a gender quota in political office, to help increase representation of women to be more proportional to men than is the case currently in most if not all political offices. Quotas have neutral to positive effects on the quality of politicians, and they normalize women getting into politics.

Gender quotas can take several forms. They can be reserved seats in political office, they can be quotas for candidates on ballots, or they can be voluntary quotas for candidates in political parties<ref>https://www.idea.int/data-tools/data/gender-quotas/quotas</ref>.

These quotas increase the representation of women within politics<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3162/036298009787500330</ref>.

Under such quota systems, the experience and decision-making ability of the candidates, primarily in terms of education, is the same if not better. This is because mediocre male politicians are pushed out of offices as a result of quotas<ref>https://academic.oup.com/book/6058/chapter/149497081</ref><ref>https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/politics-and-gender/article/second-among-unequals-a-study-of-whether-frances-quota-women-are-up-to-the-job/91FA7B3D678ECBAC5472C8C58E650BA6</ref><ref>https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20160080</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272714001480</ref>.

Gender quotas help to normalize women in politics, having a cultural effect separate from the policy itself, helping to get more women into office through increasing the interest of potential female candidates and increasing the number of people who vote for female candidates<ref>https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/124/4/1497/1917190</ref>.

Female legislators tend to place higher emphasis on women's issues and children/family concerns, but also on general economic and health issues. They are more likely to cause increases in government expenditures towards public health and decreases in government expenditures towards military and other areas<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00202.x</ref><ref>http://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1246248/FULLTEXT01</ref>.

### Matriarchy

A matriarchy is a social system in which the mother or a female elder has absolute authority over the family group, and by extension, one or more women exert a similar level of authority over the community as a whole. Under this definition, matriarchal societies have never existed<ref>https://www.britannica.com/topic/matriarchy</ref>. Dube & Harish (2017) looked at the effect of female rule on war among European polities between the 15th and 20th centuries. They found that polities led by queens are more likely to engage in war than polities led by kings<ref>https://www.nber.org/papers/w23337</ref>.

### Toxic Masculinity

Conformity to masculine norms of self-reliance, power over women, and playboy are related to worse mental health outcomes, while conformity to the masculine norm of the primacy of work is not significantly related to any mental health related outcome<ref>https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/cou-cou0000176.pdf</ref>. Girls' adherence to masculinity norms is also associated with less psychosocial well-being<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jora.12475</ref>.

### Declining Female Happiness

The happiest combination of traits for a worker tends to be male, middle-aged, married, high household income, in a senior management position, in a senior management position, with one young child at home and a wife who works part-time. The unhappiest combination of traits for a worker tends to be female, middle-aged, unmarried and without children, with a household income below $100,000, and in a professional position. Men tend to be consistently happier than women in and out of the office<ref>https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/high-octane-women/201109/meet-the-least-happy-people-in-america</ref>. Part of this is likely due to the double burden that women have nowadays of being expected to both work and do household labor, as well as the fact that women tend to worry more about the well-being of their families. From the 1970s to around 2010 at least, women's subjective well-being has declined both absolutely speaking and also relative to men<ref>https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w14969/w14969.pdf</ref>. This has led to a reversal of the gender gap in happiness, where in the 1970s women were happier than men, and now men are happier than women.

### Sexual Assault

Survey data suggests that about one out of five undergraduate women experience an attempted or completed sexual assault during their college years<ref>https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/221153.pdf</ref>.

### Male Disposability

Empathic sadness was higher in women, but both men and women display higher empathic sadness toward women than toward men<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5112287/</ref>.

There exists a greater moral condemnation of men's assaults on women and the belief that the victims of these assaults are in greater danger. This does not depend on gender, age, level of education, or political ideology of the respondent<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19746441/</ref>.

### Attitudes/Stereotypes

Women have a higher in-group bias than men<ref>https://rutgerssocialcognitionlab.weebly.com/uploads/1/3/9/7/13979590/rudmangoodwin2004jpsp.pdf</ref><ref>https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-04384-1_9</ref>.

Feminist activist women have a more masculine 2d:4d digit ratio and tend to be more dominant in their personality<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4158978/</ref>.

Women tend to prefer benevolent sexist men to nonsexist men<ref>https://files.catbox.moe/r4e3eb.pdf</ref><ref>https://files.catbox.moe/1scdcp.pdf</ref>.

### Rape Accusations

The rate of false reports of sexual assault tends to be found to be about 5%. However, the total false reporting rate, including both confirmed and equivocal cases would be greater than this 5% rate<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-015-0666-2</ref>.

The more similar the 2D:4D digit ratio was between men and women in a country, the more equal the sexes were in parliamentary and labor force participation<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/147470491401200406#</ref>.

### Workplace Gender Gaps

After adjusting for human capital development, work experience, the occupations and industries in which the sexes work, and career interruptions, the adjusted gender pay gap is between 4.8-7.1%. Other unadjusted factors include health insurance, other fringe benefits, and detailed features of overtime work<ref>https://www.academia.edu/35974504/An_Analysis_of_Reasons_for_the_Disparity_in_Wages_Between_Men_and_Women_Containing_A_Foreword_by_the_Department_of_Labor_A_Report_by_CONSAD_Research_Corp_0</ref>.

The life satisfaction of men and especially fathers increases steeply with paid working hours. The life satisfaction of childless women is less related to long working hours and the life satisfaction of mothers hardly depends on working hours at all. Additionally, women and especially mothers are more satisfied with life when their male partners work longer while the life satisfaction of men hardly depends on their female partners' work hours. These differences are starker where gender attitudes are more traditional, but cannot be explained through differences in income, occupations, partner characteristics, period or cohort effects. These results are found in various cultures around the world<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11205-020-02433-5</ref>.

There tends to be prejudice against female leaders and against women getting promotions<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11199-006-9068-1</ref><ref>https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0021-9010.91.4.777</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0927537116301129?via%3Dihub</ref>.

In nursing, 9 out of 10 doctors are women. Here, there is approximately a $5000 salary gap even after adjusting for factors such as experience, education, work hours, clinical specialty, and marital and parental status<ref>https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/even-in-nursing-no-equal-pay-for-women/</ref>.

Between 1970 and 2007, many women entered highly rewarded occupations. However, this decreased the pay levels of these occupations due to them being feminized, particular in high-paid and male-typed occupations<ref>https://academic.oup.com/sf/article-abstract/91/4/1183/2235777</ref>.

Women tend to negotiate salaries less, but this is in part due to the different ways in which society responds to women when they negotiate. Women who ask tend to get penalized more<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749597806000884</ref>.

Hiring experiments have shown that for mixed-gender and male stereotypical jobs gender discrimination was eliminated or if anything slightly reversed starting in 2009. Anti-male discrimination persisted over time in female stereotypical jobs however<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749597823000560#:~:text=A%20meta%2Danalysis%20of%20field,the%20degree%20of%20remaining%20bias</ref>.

A Finnish study found that women and men worked approximately equal hours, but that the women devoted 50% more time to domestic work. Irrespective of gender, negative work-family spillover (work demands interfering with family affairs) was associated with health problems. Paid work hours per week for women (men) were 41.7 (42.8), domestic hours per week were 29.8 (20.6), and total work hours per week were 71.2 (63.5). Women were significantly more negatively affected by negative family-work spillover than men (family affairs interfering with work demands). Only for men, there was a positive association between sickness absence and domestic work hours. Women had slightly higher psychological distress and men had slightly higher suboptimal health. Both of these differences were only a few percentage points<ref>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1300/J013v40n03_01</ref>.

### Random

<span style="color: red">Feminists tend to report lower levels of hostility toward men than nonfeminists (Anderson et al., 2009).

### Marriage and Families

Paternal incarceration is associated with increased physical aggression for boys, and these effects are concentrated among boys whose fathers were neither incarcerated for a violent offense nor abusive to the boys' mother. The removal of abusive fathers has on net results decreased physical aggression for boys<ref>https://academic.oup.com/sf/article-abstract/89/1/285/2235254?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login=false</ref>.

Age gaps in relationships are natural and exist cross-culturally<ref>https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/0E112ACEB2E7BC877805E3AC11ABC889/S0140525X00023992a.pdf/sex-differences-in-human-mate-preferences-evolutionary-hypotheses-tested-in-37-cultures.pdf</ref>.

Legalizing unilateral divorce increases female labor force, decreases marriages but increases marriage quality, may reduce child well-being, increases household saving rates, and reduces domestic violence and female suicide. Unilateral divorce combined with equal division of property may depress female employment. Because there is some evidence that children can be harmed by unilateral divorce, easy divorce should be accompanied by policies aimed at supporting children in vulnerable families<ref>https://wol.iza.org/articles/should-divorce-be-easier-or-harder</ref>.
