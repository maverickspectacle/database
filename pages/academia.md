## Schooling

### Returns to Education

According to Abel & Deitz (2019), the average annual rate of return for a college bachelor's degree, in spite of rising college costs, is around 14%, meaning it is still a good investment<ref>https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2019/06/despite-rising-costs-college-is-still-a-good-investment/</ref>. Research suggests that there is large variation depending on a number of factors. While college selectivity and where one studies has relatively little effect on a person's long-term financial returns to their education<ref>https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00992285</ref><ref>https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1162/003355302320935089</ref>, what a person studies has a large effect on their financial returns<ref>https://www.economist.com/united-states/2015/03/12/it-depends-what-you-study-not-where</ref>.

Literacy and numeracy have substantial economic value. More years in education alone does not improve this economic value, but it must be combined with a rigorous evaluation and curriculum<ref>https://wol.iza.org/articles/what-is-economic-value-of-literacy-and-numeracy</ref>.

### Homeschooling

There are a variety of reasons why parents and youth may decide to do homeschooling, including increasing family bonding, to accomplish more academically, to customize or individualize the curriculum and learning environment, to provide a safer environment, or to teach and impart a particular set of values, beliefs, or worldview.The home-educated tend to score above average on achievement tests regardless of their parents' level of formal education and also score above average on SAT and ACT tests. The home-educated typically do above average on measures of social, emotional, and psychological development and tend to engage more in civic life in adulthood. The causality of these relationships is not clear however<ref>https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED556234.pdf</ref>.

### Schooling and Crime

Improved schooling reduces crime rates. The causal link does not appear to be the reverse, as this was researched using randomized treatment, thus in effect acting as an experiment<ref>https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/12308135/Deming_BSLC_QJE.pdf?sequence=1</ref>.

### Effects of Class Size

Class size increases educational attainment even controlling for IQ<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.2307/1164099</ref>.

### Performance-Related Pay

Performance-related pay positively affects student test scores, especially those which were group-based as opposed to individual-based<ref>https://fordhaminstitute.org/national/commentary/does-teacher-merit-pay-affect-student-test-scores</ref>.

### Charter Schools

Charter schools have very heterogeneous effects depending on the study, although on the net there is a small positive effect of charter schools on elementary reading and math, as well as middle school math. There is no statistically significant effect on middle school reading or high school reading or math<ref>https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED526353.pdf</ref>.

Charter schools tend to be more fiscally costly for school districts because separate governance arrangements can create excess costs and the financing policies can distribute resources to or away from districts<ref>http://www.columbia.edu/~rr2165/pdfs/nycharterfiscal.pdf</ref>.

### School Choice

School choice improves academic outcomes for both choice participants and public schools, saves tax dollars, and reduces racial segregation<ref>https://www.edchoice.org/research-library/?report=win-win-solution/</ref>.

### Head Start Program

Compared to at-home care, attending a head start center generates significant positive effects on children's development, although the small average effects exist when comparing Head Start to similar programs<ref>https://www.irle.berkeley.edu/files/2016/IRLE-Revisiting-the-impact-of-Head-Start.pdf</ref>. Moreover, head start has a positive effect on years of education, and beneficial impacts on wage income located at the lower end of the distribution<ref>https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/142354/1/dp9915.pdf</ref>.

### Partisan Bias

There is little evidence of partisan bias in political science grading<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1532673X14561655?journalCode=aprb</ref>.

### Tuition Control

Controlling tuition is often difficult due to substitutions between tuition and fees<ref>https://www.mhec.org/sites/default/files/resources/mhec_affordability_series3_20170824.pdf</ref>.

Per dollar, price cuts are less effective per-dollar than spending increases in terms of increasing postsecondary attainment. Spending has large impacts on enrollment and degree completion<ref>https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/ddeming/files/DW_Aug2017.pdf</ref>.

There are only two state policies that are effective in limiting tuition increases. The first is linking tuition to financial aid (high tuition, high financial aid; low tuition, low financial aid), and the second is providing incentives to limit the tuition increase. Tuition was more likely to increase when individual institutions have tuition-setting authority. The average institutional tuition increase in states having tuition caps was higher than increases at institutions in states without tuition caps. This could be because once public universities hear of a cap possibility to be mandated by state authorities, they might preemptively raise tuition and fees. Moreover, since state governments usually don't have enough information about the relationship between the various costs and the quality of learning, it can be hard for states to monitor the rising tuition and fees. Once states set higher tuition caps, institutions may increase tuition up to the limit<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274489492_The_Impacts_of_State_Control_Policies_on_College_Tuition_Increase</ref>.

### Tuition Aid

Financial aid and education subsidies increase student demand, and thus increase prices<ref>https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa531.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.jamesgmartin.center/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Bennett_Hypothesis_Paper_Final-1.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.cato.org/blog/cancelling-student-debt-would-inflate-college-prices-suddenly-people-dont-it</ref>.

Degree inflation is becoming widespread in the US and is making its economy more inefficient. Posting for many jobs traditionally viewed as middle-skills jobs which required a high school diploma only now require at least a college degree. Part of this is due to the changing nature of many middle-skills jobs which require computer proficiency and good written and verbal communications, but it also has to do with misperceptions<ref>https://www.hbs.edu/managing-the-future-of-work/Documents/dismissed-by-degrees.pdf</ref>.

### Tuition Fees

The mean tuition-enrollment elasticity across studies is close to zero after controlling for publication bias<ref>http://meta-analysis.cz/education/education.pdf</ref>.

Attending a relatively high tuition college has a net positive influence on educational attainment, occupational status, and income. This remained significant even after controlling for student background characteristics such as socioeconomic origins, secondary school achievement, and educational and occupational aspirations. It still remained significant after controlling for academic selectivity and private/public control<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mark-Smylie/publication/226126111_College_Tuition_Costs_and_Early_Career_Socioeconomic_Achievement_Do_You_Get_What_You_Pay_For/links/55b21bd608aed621ddfd840d/College-Tuition-Costs-and-Early-Career-Socioeconomic-Achievement-Do-You-Get-What-You-Pay-For.pdf</ref>.

### Returns to Education

There exists substantial sheepskin effects on returns to education, where there are increases in earnings due to the credential itself as opposed to the underlying skills or abilities demonstrated by individuals<ref>http://econ.queensu.ca/pub/jdi/deutsch/edu_conf/Ferrer.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/188353/1/pjcss433.pdf</ref>.

In 2011, a Russian educational reform shortened the university study period by one year and reduced the content of the curricula but did not change the quality of admitted students. This had no adverse effect on wages and on the probability of being employed, suggesting no returns to higher education<ref>https://wp.hse.ru/data/2020/09/22/1584505319/236EC2020.pdf</ref>.

## Peer Review and Publication Bias

Peer reviewers tend to be biased against manuscripts which report results contrary to their theoretical perspective or political orientation, independent of the quality of the paper<ref>Abramowitz, S. I., Gomes, B., & Abramowitz, C. V. (1975). Publish or politic: Referee Bias in Manuscript review1. Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 5(3), 187–200. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1559-1816.1975.tb00675.x</ref><ref>Mahoney, M. J. (1977). Publication prejudices: An experimental study of confirmatory bias in the peer review system. Cognitive Therapy and Research, 1(2), 161–175. https://doi.org/10.1007/bf01173636</ref>.

In the case of non-blinded peer review, the prominence of an author strongly biases whether a paper is accepted for peer review<ref>Sci-Hub | Effect of Blinded Peer Review on Abstract Acceptance. JAMA, 295(14), 1675 | 10.1001/JAMA.295.14.1675. (n.d.). https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.295.14.1675</ref><ref>Sci-Hub | Reviewer bias in single- versus double-blind peer review.

(n.d.). https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1707323114</ref><ref>Huber, J., Inoua, S., Kerschbamer, R., König-Kersting, C., Palan, S., Smith, V.

In University of Graz, School of Business, Economics and Social Sciences Working Paper (No. 2022–01). https://files.catbox.moe/z0pp2y.pdf</ref>.

There tends to be low interrater reliability amongst peer reviewers<ref>Mahoney, M. J. (1977). Publication prejudices: An experimental study of confirmatory bias in the peer review system. Cognitive Therapy and Research, 1(2), 161–175. https://doi.org/10.1007/bf01173636</ref><ref>Sci-Hub | Reproducibility of peer review in clinical neuroscience: Is agreement between reviewers any greater than would be expected by chance alone?

To test the effectiveness of peer review process in selecting for high-quality papers, John Bohannon submitted 304 versions of a fatally flawed paper to open-access journals. More than half of the journals accepted the paper<ref>Bohannon, J. (2013). Who’s afraid of peer review? Science, 342(6154), 60–65. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.2013.342.6154.342_60</ref>.

Suggested solutions to the issue of peer review include blinding reviewers to the identity of authors, opening up peer review, and training peer reviewers, something that does not happen<ref>Smith, R. (2006). Peer review: a flawed process at the heart of science and journals. Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, 99(4), 178–182. https://doi.org/10.1258/jrsm.99.4.178</ref>.

There tends to exist a bias in favor of studies which are statistically significant, often with positive results, and against studies which fail to reject a null hypothesis<ref>Sci-Hub | Consequences of prejudice against the null hypothesis. Psychological Bulletin, 82(1), 1–20 | 10.1037/h0076157. (n.d.). https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1037/h0076157</ref><ref>Statistical significance, reviewer evaluations, and the scientific process: Is there a (statistically) significant relationship?

Statistically significantly outcomes have a higher probability of being fully reported compared to non-significant outcomes<ref>Dwan, K., Altman, D. G., Arnaiz, J. A., Bloom, J., Chan, A., Cronin, E., Decullier, E., Easterbrook, P. J., Von Elm, E., Gamble, C., Ghersi, D., Ioannidis, J. P. A., Simes, J., & Williamson, P. R. (2008).

Positive results are becoming increasingly more common in published papers over time<ref>Fanelli, D. (2011). Negative results are disappearing from most disciplines and countries. Scientometrics, 90(3), 891–904. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-011-0494-7</ref>, and positive results tend to receive significantly more citations than null or negative results, at least amongst applied disciplines and the biological sciences<ref>Fanelli, D. (2012). Positive results receive more citations, but only in some disciplines. Scientometrics, 94(2), 701–709. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-012-0757-y</ref>. Positive results create publication bias in meta-analyses<ref>Song, F., Parekh-Bhurke, S., Hooper, L., Loke, Y. K., Ryder, J. J., Sutton, A. J., Hing, C. B., & Harvey, I. (2009).

Physicians ratings of a journal's quality are positively correlated with their impact factor<ref>Saha, S., Saint, S., & Christakis, D. A. (2003). Impact factor: a valid measure of journal quality? In J Med Libr Assoc (Vol. 91, Issue 1). https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC141186/pdf/i0025-7338-091-01-0042.pdf</ref>. There is a statistically significant relationship between effect strength and journal quality measured by impact factor<ref>Murtaugh, P. A. (2002). JOURNAL QUALITY, EFFECT SIZE, AND PUBLICATION BIAS IN META-ANALYSIS. The Ecological Society of America. https://doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083</ref>.

Single-blind peer reviewers are significantly more likely than double-blind counterparts to recommend for acceptance papers from famous authors, top universities, and top companies<ref>Tomkins, A., Zhang, M., & Heavlin, W. D. (2017). Reviewer bias in single- versus double-blind peer review. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 114(48), 12708–12713. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1707323114</ref>.

While manuscripts appear to be improved by blinded peer reviewing<ref>Fletcher, R. H., & Fletcher, S. W. (1997). Evidence for the effectiveness of peer review. Science and Engineering Ethics, 3(1), 35–50. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11948-997-0015-5</ref>, research suggests that at least in social work few referees from prestigious or nonprestigious journals prepare reviews that are knowledgably, scientifically astute, or objective<ref>Sci-Hub | What errors do peer reviewers detect, and does training improve their                ability to detect them? Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, 101(10), 507–514 | 10.1258/jrsm.2008.080062. (n.d.). https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1258/jrsm.2008.080062</ref><ref>Sci-Hub | Confirmational Response Bias among Social Work Journals.

In research on road safety evaluation studies, there are very few statistically reliable differences in study validity between studies published in peer reviewed journals and studies not published in such journals<ref>Sci-Hub | Are road safety evaluation studies published in peer reviewed journals more valid than similar studies not published in peer reviewed journals? Accident Analysis & Prevention, 30(1), 101–118 | 10.1016/s0001-4575(97)00068-7. (n.d.). https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/S0001-4575(97)00068-7</ref>.

Polling of university professors finds that there are many pernicious publication practices, including false criticisms and inferior expertise from peer reviewers<ref>Sci-Hub | Pernicious publication practices. Bulletin of the Psychonomic Society, 18(1), 31–34 | 10.3758/bf03333562. (n.d.). https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.3758/BF03333562</ref>.

Across all disciplines, papers are more likely to support a tested hypothesis if their corresponding authors work in states that produce more academic papers per capita. This suggests that competitive academic environments may increase scientists' bias<ref>Fanelli, D. (2010). Do Pressures to Publish Increase Scientists’ Bias? An Empirical Support from US States Data. PLoS ONE, 5(4), e10271. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0010271</ref>.

## Experts

It is only a relatively small number of physicists who contribute substantially to the advance of science through their research. Only about 15-20% of the work cited in significant discoveries is produced by average scientists. Even papers of minor significance tend to disproportionately use the work of eminent scientists. Most articles published even in leading journals receive very few citations. Independent multiple discoveries are extremely common within science, so the work of average scientists can easily be replaced. Major contributions to teaching are also likely done by a small handful of scientists, as the great majority of elite scientists are trained by other members of the elite<ref>https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.178.4059.368</ref>.

In many cases there exists a necessity to publish for the purposes of career advancement. This leads to poor research design and data analysis<ref>https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsos.160384</ref>.

Competition amongst scientists leads to strategic game-playing in science, a decline in free and open sharing of information and methods, sabotage of others' ability to use one's work, interference with peer-review processes, deformation of relationships, and careless or questionable research conduct.
Competition among scientists for funding, positions and prestige, among other things, is often seen as a salutary driving force in U.S. science. Its effects on scientists, their work and their relationships are seldom considered. Focus-group discussions with 51 mid- and early-career scientists, on which this study is based, reveal a dark side of competition in science. According to these scientists, competition contributes to strategic game-playing in science, a decline in free and open sharing of information and methods, sabotage of others' ability to use one's work, interference with peer-review processes, deformation of relationships, and careless or questionable research conduct. When competition is pervasive, such effects may jeopardize the progress, efficiency and integrity of science<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1007/s11948-007-9042-5</ref>.

Breznau et al. (2022) coordinated 161 researchers in 73 research teams to examine their research decisions as they used the same data to independently test the hypothesis that greater immigration reduces public support for social policies. Research teams reported both widely different numerical findings and substantive conclusions despite identical start conditions. Researchers' expertise, prior beliefs, and expectations barely predicted the variation. In fact, more than 95% of the variance remained unexplained. This suggests that many scientific hypotheses remain uncontested for valid reasons<ref>https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2203150119</ref>.

Data in abstracts that are inconsistent with or absent from the body of an article is a common occurrence, even within large-circulation general medical journals<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.281.12.1110</ref>.

There exists a positive correlation between the prestige of a management research article and its reading difficulty. Passages that are more difficult to read but with identical content are rated as higher in research competence. This suggests that management scientists gain prestige through unintelligible writing<ref>https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1287/inte.10.2.80</ref>.

Eichorn & Yankauer (1987) looked at a random sample of 50 references in three public health journals. They found that 31% of the total 150 references had citation errors<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.77.8.1011</ref>.

## Scientific Progress

Scientific collaborations are characterized by hot spots and hot moments which are short but intense periods of collaboration which drive scientific and intellectual social movements. Emotions and bonding are essential for the group's growth and development, but increased size and diversity have the potential to erode the affective culture that generated initial successes<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0003122411433763</ref>.

## Misconduct, Mistakes, and Retractions in Academia

Misconduct, mistakes, and retractions are common within academia, although getting precise estimates for its prevalence is difficult<ref>https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0005738</ref><ref>https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/10.1098/rspa.2020.0538</ref>. Misconduct appears to be rising significantly, although it is not clear whether this is due to improved screening practices or changes in the number of publications which have research containing misconduct<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1212247109</ref><ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1136/jme.2010.040923</ref>. Higher journal impact factor is positively associated with misconduct as well, although again it is not clear whether this is a screening issue or a publication quality issue<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1128/IAI.05661-11</ref>. Much of this fraud appears to be deliberately done<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1136/jme.2010.038125</ref>. Luckily, retractions which occur as a consequence of misconduct result in the author of the publication getting fewer citations in the future, suggesting there is a degree of self-correction which occurs in academia dealing with this<ref>https://www.nature.com/articles/srep03146</ref>. There are a variety of reasons why misconduct occurs<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1007/s11948-007-9045-2</ref>. Much of this research suggests that academia can be fallible in this domain.

## Political Leanings of Academics

Academics lean overwhelmingly left today<ref>https://econjwatch.org/articles/faculty-voter-registration-in-economics-history-journalism-communications-law-and-psychology</ref><ref>http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.120.9897&rep=rep1&type=pdf</ref>, although in the past it has been more balanced. This is partially due to differences in intelligence and openness to experience, although this cannot explain all of it. Part of it is also due to self-selection, a hostile climate for right-wingers, and discrimination of right-wingers<ref>https://www.adamsmith.org/research/lackademia-why-do-academics-lean-left</ref><ref>https://psyarxiv.com/qpn57/</ref>. Viewpoint diversity promotes creativity, discovery, and problem-solving, while viewpoint homogeneity promotes confirmation bias and conformity, so having more of a balance of viewpoints will help progress social science<ref>https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/10.1017/s0140525x15000035</ref>. However, it does not appear that this will affect the political orientation of students, who's political ideology doesn't change with faculty ideology and instead reflects trends of the broader population in their age group<ref>https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ps-political-science-and-politics/article/abs/indoctrination-u-faculty-ideology-and-changes-in-student-political-orientation/25ABD9B1A3577F27B5659941CD52D6C9</ref>.

## Replicability in Science

There exists a replicability crisis in science, particularly in the social sciences<ref>https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aac4716</ref><ref>https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaf0918</ref><ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325216701_Estimating_the_Reproducibility_of_Experimental_Philosophy</ref><ref>https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-018-0399-z</ref>. Still, replicability varies between subsets of the social sciences. The degree to which a publication or finding is replicable can in fact be predicted well by scientists<ref>https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-018-0399-z</ref>, but are published by journals because they are more interesting. Journal prestige in fact is negatively correlated to replicability<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2018.00037</ref>. This appears to be due to intense competition and time pressure. Nonreplicable publications are cited more than replicable ones<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abd1705</ref>.

## Statistical Competence of Academics

Academics are relatively lacking in their knowledge of data analysis and their ability to accurately interpret statistical information<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00207590244000250</ref><ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283175190_Blinding_Us_to_the_Obvious_The_Effect_of_Statistical_Training_on_the_Evaluation_of_Evidence</ref><ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24420726/</ref><ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235363101_Contemporary_Issues_in_the_Analysis_of_Data_A_Survey_of_551_Psychologists</ref><ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/27262211_Misinterpretations_of_Significance_A_Problem_Students_Share_with_Their_Teachers</ref><ref>https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/D1520CFBFEB2C282E93484057D84B6C6/S183449091900028Xa.pdf/beyond_psychology_prevalence_of_p_value_and_confidence_interval_misinterpretation_across_different_fields.pdf</ref>.

## Censorship in Academia

There is a very strong anti right-wing bias in academia in terms of the endorsement of censoring right-wing beliefs. This appears to exist amongst both students and faculty<ref>https://cspicenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AcademicFreedom.pdf</ref><ref>https://heterodoxacademy.org/blog/what-the-data-say-about-student-support-for-shout-downs-blockades-and-violence/</ref><ref>https://www.thefire.org/research-learn/academic-mind-2022-what-faculty-think-about-free-expression-and-academic-freedom</ref>.

Taking offense is a common experience on campuses and a sizable number of students are in favor of restricting speech on campuses. There is evidence of conformity pressures existing on university campuses. Left-leaning students are less likely to tolerate controversial viewpoints and right-leaning students are more likely to self-censor on politically sensitive issues such as gender, immigration, or sexual and ethnic minorities<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11577-020-00713-z</ref>.

## Unsorted

Identical papers published in journals with a higher impact factor receive twice as many citations<ref>https://arxiv.org/abs/0908.3177</ref>.

Replicability and research quality decreases as the journal ranking increases<ref>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2018.00037/full</ref>.

Distrust in science has grown significantly since the onset of COVID<ref>https://www.kumc.edu/communications/about/publications/kansas-medicine-and-science/spring-summer-2023/why-do-so-many-americans-distrust-science.html#:~:text=THE%20CAUSES%20OF%20SCIENCE%20DISTRUST&text=It%20can%20be%20particularly%20challenging,understand%20why%2C%E2%80%9D%20Smith%20said</ref>. There are numerous factors behind this<ref>https://www.aamc.org/news/why-do-so-many-americans-distrust-science</ref>:
*People are overwhelmed by information, and cannot sort out what is true from false
*Trust in institutions is eroding
*Americans are becoming more socially divided and polarized
*Faux experts instill doubt in people
*Contradicting findings undermine trust
*Some groups profit from disinformation

Statistical significance thresholds dichotomize evidence which is cringe<ref>https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.2017.1289846#.YeL28GjMKUk</ref>.
