## Economic Freedom

**Economic freedom = based**

A 2013 systematic literature review on the effects of economic freedom found that in the vast majority of studies that cite the economic freedom index, it is associated with mostly good outcomes<ref>https://doi.org/10.1111/coep.12010</ref>. The only main exception to this is that some of the negative studies suggested that economic freedom increases income inequality. There is a vast literature of studies which look at the effects of economic freedom in a wide variety of domains:

***Economic Growth -** Doucouliagos & Ulubasoglu (2006) used meta-analytic techniques to the literature on economic freedom and economic growth and found that there is a positive association between the two<ref>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2005.06.003</ref>. Granger causality analysis suggests that for both industrial and nonindustrial countries, this is a positive feedback loop in which both variables cause one another<ref>https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.482.8647&rep=rep1&type=pdf</ref>. This effect operates through a number of channels, which include low money growth rate, small role played by government enterprises, rare negative real interest rates, small difference between the official and black-market exchange rates, large size of the trade sector, and the freedom of citizens to engage in capital transactions with foreigners<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/30025774</ref>.

***Inequality -** Consistent with Hall & Lawson (2013), some research does suggest that economic freedom increases income inequality<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11127-006-9078-0</ref>, although there is no clear consensus<ref>https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1465-7287.2012.00343.x</ref><ref>https://ideas.repec.org/a/ipf/finteo/v39y2015i4p349-370.html</ref>. This is consistent with the well-known hypothesized tradeoff between equity and efficiency<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/30025774</ref>, in which countries with higher economic growth have to sacrifice a level of economic inequality. However, many studies which find that economic freedom increases inequality have notable caveats to it. For example, Ahmed (2017) finds that this effect is attenuated with democratic regimes, and Bauer (2016) finds that this is balanced out by an overall higher quality of life among citizens who live under conditions of higher economic freedom<ref>https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7099/5/2/18</ref><ref>https://digitalcommons.liberty.edu/honors/597/</ref>.

***Poverty and Social Mobility -** Economic freedom is associated with both lower poverty<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5021345_Poverty_and_Economic_Freedom_Evidence_from_Cross-Country_Data</ref>, and increased social mobility<ref>https://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/islandora/object/fsu:204636/datastream/PDF/view</ref>.

***Innovation -** Economic freedom increases innovation<ref>https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Economic-Freedom-and-Innovation-Erkan/f17a0d7f0cdc279a506b6da67eb025c73a74a721</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1062976916300114</ref>.

***Labor Markets -** Economic freedom reduces unemployment, and increases labor force participation and employment-population ratios<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/20111958?seq=1</ref><ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/coep.12031</ref>.

***Debt Risk -** Even after controlling for a variety of factors, lower economic freedom results in a significantly higher borrowing cost for a country<ref>https://0x0.la/u/KGY9lnX.pdf</ref>.

***Quality of Life -** Economic freedom is significantly positively associated with a multitude of indicators of quality of life<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1009068829135</ref><ref>http://journal.apee.org/index.php/2014.Fall.JPE_part5.pdf</ref>, including happiness<ref>https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/18509341.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/cato-journal/2011/5/cj31n2-4.pdf#page=17</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305750X13001150?via%3Dihub</ref><ref>https://www.shs-conferences.org/articles/shsconf/pdf/2016/06/shsconf_rptss2016_01109.pdf</ref><ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-016-9770-9</ref>, longer life expectancy<ref>https://www.mercatus.org/students/research/working-papers/private-property-rights-economic-freedom-and-well-being</ref>, and increased health, education, and disease prevention<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305750X0600180X</ref>.

***Civil Society -** Economic freedom is associated with greater democracy<ref>https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/231765996.pdf</ref>, greater political freedom<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167268110000430</ref>, lower governmental corruption<ref>https://uca.edu/cahss/files/2020/07/02-Cramer-CLA-2020.pdf</ref>, a reduction in conflict<ref>http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.319.4651&rep=rep1&type=pdf</ref>, and greater tolerance of different groups of people<ref>https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2045577#:~:text=Regression%20analysis%20of%20up%20to,by%20how%20free%20markets%20are</ref><ref>https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/2021-01/economic-freedom-of-the-world-2020-chapter-3.pdf</ref>.

***Air Quality -** Economic freedom appears to create incentives to abate local air pollution such as fine particulate matter, although such incentives do not appear to be created for carbon dioxide emissions which are more global in nature<ref>https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/economic-freedom-and-air-quality.pdf</ref>. This would make sense given the difficulty of coordination on an international scale which is required to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.

## Socialism

Socialism is gay and cringe.

### Efficiency

Capitalism and its associated legal and cultural institutions are associated with much higher economic efficiency:

- Economic institutions, such as well-specific property rights, the rule of law, economic freedom, and the quality of government, are positively related with human well-being<ref>https://college.holycross.edu/eej/Volume29/V29N1P23_40.pdf</ref>.
- Individualism is positively related to long-run growth and innovation<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165176512006362</ref><ref>https://eml.berkeley.edu/~ygorodni/gorrol_culture.pdf</ref>.
- Economic freedom indicators, while having problems, still demonstrate that liberalization stimulates economic growth<ref>https://0x0.la/u/Wk50PsO.pdf</ref>.
- Socialist economies have generally underperformed relative to developed and most other developing economies<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/41770296</ref>.
- Developing countries that score better in protecting economic rights tend to grow faster, score higher in human development, and economic rights are associated with democratic government and higher levels of average national income<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02687323</ref>.
- Privately owned firms are more efficient and more profitable than otherwise comparable state-owned firms<ref>https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.39.2.321</ref>.
- Market economies tend to have more productive efficiency compared to state socialist economies<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256353073_Productive_efficiency_under_capitalism_and_state_socialism</ref>.

Specific cases:

- The Soviet Union initially had high economic growth due to the fact that as a developing economy it could adopt western technology while forcibly mobilizing resources to use such technology. Once the country began to catch up with the west, it could no longer do this and its productivity diminished. Various piecemeal reforms it attempted undermined its institutions and failed to improve the situation<ref>https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/021716/why-ussr-collapsed-economically.asp#citation-2</ref>.
- Xiaogang farmers, who agreed in 1978 to have personal property and no longer have collectivization, immediately had a massive increase in their agricultural productivity. This was used as a model for the rest of the Chinese economy to move to a market system<ref>https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2012/01/20/145360447/the-secret-document-that-transformed-china</ref>.
- Delayed economic reform in India because of its prolonged experiment with socialism led to over ten million "missing children", amongst other negative effects on quality of life<ref>https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/dbp4.pdf#page=7</ref>.

### Quality of Life

Social democratic policies are associated with higher quality of life:

- In general, high democracy, strong left-wing regimes, social democratic welfare states, high public spending, fair trade policies, extensions to compulsory education provision, microfinance initiatives in low-income countries, health and safety policy, and high-quality affordable housing have positive health outcomes, while neoliberal restructuring seems to be associated with increased health inequalities and higher income inequality with lower health and mortality<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2190/EQUY-ACG8-X59F-AE99</ref><ref>https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2019.305001</ref>.
- Political traditions more committed to redistributive policies and full-employment policies have generally been more successful in improving population health<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11330781/</ref>.

However, markets are also associated with higher quality of life, implying a mixed economy approach is best for human well-being:

- Low regulation and pro market attitudes have positive effects on life satisfaction<ref>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13504851.2012.762709</ref>.
- Increases in economic freedom correspond to larger reductions of the extreme poverty rate<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20200215062544/http://myweb.fsu.edu:80/jsc07e/Documents/Papers/Connors%20-%20Economic%20Institutions%20and%20Global%20Poverty.pdf</ref>.
- There is a strong positive association between reforms towards more free markets with regard to governments' respect for human rights<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11127-011-9847-2</ref>.
- Capitalism does not show a preference for war<ref>https://pages.ucsd.edu/~egartzke/publications/gartzke_ajps_07-1.pdf</ref><ref>https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/mharrison/public/capitalism_at_war.pdf</ref>.

Gains in some socialist countries appear to be primarily due to improvements in healthcare and education, as opposed to economic central planning itself:

- Between 1950-1980, China experienced the most rapid sustained increase in life expectancy of any population in documented global history, primarily through gains in school enrollment and public health campaigns<ref>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00324728.2014.972432?journalCode=rpst20</ref>.

## Labor Exploitation

### Child Labor

Historically, bans on child labor have not been the primary reason for declines in child labor, but rather improvements in industrialization and economic growth which brought rising incomes which allowed parents to keep their children out of the workforce<ref>https://sci-hub.st/10.3368/jhr.XL.1.77</ref><ref>https://eh.net/encyclopedia/child-labor-in-the-united-states/</ref>. Research in fact suggests that in the case of India's Child Labor Ban, the relative probability of child employment increased and child wages relative to adult wages decreased after the ban, as well as decreased young child participation in schooling<ref>https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/jeea/jvz059</ref>. This is consistent with the idea that families use child labor to satisfy basic subsistence needs, which don't go away simply due to a ban on child labor. Similar results have been found in Bangladesh following the 1993 United States Child Labor Deterrence Act<ref>https://www.cato.org/economic-development-bulletin/case-against-child-labor-prohibitions</ref>.

### Sweatshops and Worker Quality of Life

While sweatshops are commonly said to be unjust due to their poor labor conditions, when examining the evidence one should compare how the presence of sweatshops in **already impoverished countries** affects the workers who work in them as well as the broader domestic economy. Research suggests that multinational firms, the firms which have sweatshop jobs, pay more than domestic firms in third world countries and that sweatshop jobs provide workers with above average living standards<ref>http://hseuenglish102.pbworks.com/f/JobsworththeSweat.pdf</ref>. Foreign ownership of firms raises wages by expanding labor production and the scale of production, improving the conditions of work in the process. Not only that, but foreign-owned firms in fact make use of labor organizations and democratic institutions<ref>https://www.nber.org/system/files/chapters/c9541/c9541.pdf#page=45</ref>. While child labor occurs, the vast majority of child laborers of sweatshops and carpet factories are members of landless, very poor families, making it an economic necessity, especially in single mother families where it may be the only source of income. These are situations where children lack access to education regardless of whether they work in sweatshops or not due to them needing to work to sustain their families, regardless of the type of work<ref>https://www.cips-cepi.ca/2018/02/26/the-ethics-of-buying-clothes-produced-in-sweatshops/</ref>. All of this helps to explain why workers subjectively perceive factor employment to provide more stable compensation<ref>https://0x0.la/u/F6CEuq4.pdf</ref>.

The closure of sweatshops cuts off a major source of income for the poor in the short-run, and decreases GDP in the medium term, which helps to explain why sweatshops have been a necessary existence at some point in the development of all nations since the beginning of the industrial revolution<ref>https://www.cips-cepi.ca/2018/02/26/the-ethics-of-buying-clothes-produced-in-sweatshops/</ref>.

## Income Inequality

**Inequality Bad**

List of various effects of income inequality:

- **Health -** Pickett & Wilkinson (2015) reviewed the literature on the effect of income inequality on health and found that the overwhelming majority of evidence strongly suggests that it negatively impacts population health and well-being<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25577953/</ref>. These effects can range from infant mortality<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11476836/</ref> to incidence rate of schizophrenia<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4105302/pdf/nihms-599129.pdf</ref>. Economic growth is not associated with increases in happiness if it is accompanied by rising income inequality<ref>http://www.patbarclay.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2015-Oishi-et-al.-x.pdf</ref>.
- **Crime and social cohesion -** Income inequality is associated with increased violent and property crime and decreased social trust<ref>https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/article/21/2/241/498070</ref><ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2003-99209-003</ref><ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2523129_Inequality_And_Violent_Crime</ref><ref>https://equalitytrust.org.uk/sites/default/files/Income%20Inequality%20and%20Crime%20-%20A%20Review%20and%20Explanation%20of%20the%20Time%20series%20evidence_0.pdf</ref>. Moreover, interregional inequality increases the number of domestic terror events which occur<ref>https://www.socialcapitalgateway.org/sites/socialcapitalgateway.org/files/data/paper/2017/03/19/terrorismezcurraetal2016-regionalinequalitiesandterrorismejpe.pdf</ref>, suggesting that the effects of inequality are not limited to simple crimes. There are some notable moderators to these effects, however. Firstly, research suggests that egalitarian culture, a perception that inequality is illegitimate, moderates the relationship between inequality and crime<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1745-9125.1984.tb00299.x</ref>. It should be noted though that this is not an independent effect, which suggests that inequality could in fact shape this egalitarian culture. Second is that after controlling for poverty, inequality has no effect, at least on homicide<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1468-4446.12083</ref>. Arguably inequality naturally creates poverty due to it depriving certain people of more relative to a more egalitarian situation with identical wealth, but the precise causal nature of the relationship is still important to note.
- **Economic Growth -** Dominici et al. (2006) and Neves et al. (2016) both employed meta-analysis to examine the effect of income inequality on economic growth<ref>https://papers.tinbergen.nl/06064.pdf</ref><ref>https://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeewdevel/v_3a78_3ay_3a2016_3ai_3ac_3ap_3a386-400.htm</ref>. There was a significant amount of variation in studies due to differences in methodology, differences in the effect size in countries and regions, among other factors. Cross-sectional studies typically reported a negative relationship between inequality and growth while panel studies (which take into account longitudinally) found no net effect and produced a wide diversity of results. The high levels of heterogeneity suggest that there is no clear relationship between inequality and growth and there are potentially multiple effects running in opposite directions. Nonetheless, some clear findings were discerned. Firstly, there is a stronger negative effect of inequality on economic growth for developing countries. This is likely due to in less developed countries there being more severe constraints to human capital accumulation, as well as higher political instability and social unrest. Additionally, this is likely due to richer countries having more growth-promoting aspects of inequality related to savings and incentives. Secondly, inequality has less of an effect on economic growth in the long-run.
- **Income Mobility -** More inequality is associated with less intergenerational income mobility, due to shaping the opportunities of people. This relationship is known as "The Great Gatsby Curve"<ref>https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.27.3.79#page=4</ref><ref>https://wol.iza.org/articles/income-inequality-and-social-origins</ref>.
- **Authoritarianism -** Income inequality is associated with an increase in authoritarianism<ref>https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3273660</ref>.

Potential Positives:

- **Purchasing Power -** As income inequality increases, the market for products aimed towards the poor grows and such products become more profitable. Thus the poor will have a better purchasing power due to the increase in inferior goods provided to them<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/23809672</ref>. While this is somewhat beneficial, it does not appear to outweigh the broader negative effects on income mobility or health as laid out above and hence would not make inequality a good thing on net.

Causes of Income Inequality:

- **Regulation -** Research suggests that a 10% increase in federal regulation is associated with an approximate 0.5 percent increase in income inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient<ref>https://www.mercatus.org/system/files/chambers-regulation-inequality-mercatus-working-paper-v1.pdf</ref>.

## Minimum Wage

Minimum wage in developed countries of about 60% of the local median income has a net positive effect. It does have many limitations however and does not suffice as an efficient anti-poverty tool.

### Monopsony and Effects on Firms

There are three schools of thought when it comes to the minimum wage debate. All of these emphasize the importance of the responses that firms have to minimum wage increases as a determinant of the actual effects of minimum wages. The major two, the competitive and monopsonistic model, are in opposition as to whether a minimum wage can meaningfully improve the lives of workers.

The competitive model, which is commonly taught in basic economics courses, assumes as the name suggests that markets are perfectly competitive and always at an optimal equilibrium. A consequence of any minimum wage change will be higher unemployment and consequently an increased labor supply, due to firms being unable to afford a higher wage for their workers. This brings the market into disequilibrium and harms all parties involved<ref>https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/PA701.pdf</ref>. There is some evidence that the competitive model accurately describes the situation with the minimum wage. Firm exit is one piece of evidence which provides support for this model. If firms exist in a competitive market in which each firm has zero or near zero profit, we would expect to see that minimum wage increases would result in firms leaving, particularly lower-quality firms closer to the margin of exit. Data has shown this to be accurate<ref>https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/33111775/17-088.pdf;jsessionid=DFC2E1554F19FAD9B623717C22136BAC?sequence=1</ref>.

The second major model of the effects of a minimum wage on firm behavior is the monopsonistic or oligopsonistic model. Whereas a monopoly is a situation in which there is only one seller within a particular market, a monopsony is a situation in which there is only one buyer within a particular market. Firms are buyers within the labor market, and can thus theoretically operate as monopsonies. In the case of a monopsony, markets are not perfectly competitive, and firms have more market power. This means that they have an ability to set wages, and will deliberately avoid purchasing until the equilibrium level to hold down their own prices<ref>https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monopsony.asp</ref>. Given that wages are deliberately set below the equilibrium level, those who subscribe to the monopsony model would assert that an effectively set minimum wage would enable the market price to equal the equilibrium price, ensuring that workers are paid more without increasing their levels of unemployment. Interestingly, the monopsony model actually predicts a small increase in employment as a consequence of an effectively set minimum wage, because it increases the supply of labor without preventing firms from purchasing that labor<ref>https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/PA701.pdf</ref>, assuming the price floor is not set too high. If it is, the monopsonist will reduce its purchases within the labor market and inefficiency occurs<ref>https://eh.net/encyclopedia/monopsony-in-american-labor-markets/</ref>. Given that a monopsony is generally nonexistent in the real world, the term "oligopsony" is often used in the empirical literature to refer to a set of a few firms which generally operate in the same way as a monopsony does.

There is a fair amount of evidence that monopsonistic/oligopsonistic models have some merit to them as well. Some firms, such as those in the tomato market have been observed exhibiting oligopsonistic characteristics<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/3003381</ref>, amongst others<ref>https://eh.net/encyclopedia/monopsony-in-american-labor-markets/</ref></ref>.

In terms of the effects of minimum wage on unemployment, there is a wide literature which all appears to disagree amongst itself about the effects of the minimum wage on unemployment. However, it generally suggests that there is a null or slightly negative effect of the minimum wage on employment. This is to some extent consistent with both competitive and monopsonistic models of the minimum wage, as the effects of minimum wages don't seem to go super hard either way. This could be due in part to the degrees to which different low-wage labor markets are competitive or monopsonistic. This is discussed in later sections.
It has been found that firm profitability decreases following increases in the minimum wage. Interestingly, this is neither evidence in favor of or against either the competitive or monopsonistic model of the minimum wage, as both would naturally predict a reduction in profitability from the minimum wage<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/25760249?seq=1</ref><ref>https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/203233/1/1667730924.pdf</ref>.

A third often not mentioned model of the minimum wage is the institutional/behavioral model. This model suggests that the situation with the minimum wage is a bit more complex than a competitive model would suggest, with cost absorptions occurring in a variety of areas as opposed to strictly employment. These can include reducing sales, improving service, economic expansion, and changes in internal wage structure. Moderate minimum wage increases are said to have no employment effect or a positive employment effect<ref>https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/PA701.pdf</ref>. There is also some evidence for this model, with channels of adjustment for minimum wages including some factors which are consistent with the institutional/behavioral model, including wage compression and higher performance standards. Because of this, a minimum wage's firm-related effects can be said to go beyond simply employment<ref>https://docs.iza.org/dp6132.pdf</ref>.

In sum, all three major models for how the minimum wage operates have some degree of merit to them, and we will examine the effects of the minimum wage as they apply to all of these models when looking at the channels of adjustment that firms engage in following minimum wage increases in more detail.

### Channels of Adjustment

#### Employment

Polling suggests that economists are split on whether the minimum wage causes adverse unemployment effects, or at least whether they make it harder for low-skilled workers to find employment<ref>https://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/minimum-wage/</ref>. When looking at the actual empirical evidence on the subject, this starts to make more sense, as there is no consensus on the subject. Nonetheless, the overwhelming majority of the evidence according to meta-analytic research suggests there is no net effect of the minimum wage on employment or a small negative effect, even without taking into account publication bias which leans in favor of studies which find a negative effect of the minimum wage on employment<ref>https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1403498](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-8543.2009.00723.x</ref><ref>https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/601139/The_impact_of_the_NMW_on_employment_-_a_meta-analysis.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.nelp.org/publication/raise-wages-kill-jobs-no-correlation-minimum-wage-increases-employment-levels/</ref>. All of this is done even while also increasing the wage of workers, as minimum wage laws intend to do. The broader economic effects of minimum wage workers will be discussed in more detail later on, but keep this in mind<ref>https://irle.berkeley.edu/seattles-minimum-wage-experience-2015-16/</ref>.

In terms of measurements of the precise elasticities of employment as a result of an increase in the minimum wage, the literature generally suggests that it is around -0.1, particularly with the more recent research on the subject. This means that a 1% increase in the minimum wage would be expected to decrease employment by 0.1%, a very small decrease<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/2724487?seq=38#metadata_info_tab_contents</ref><ref>https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/844350/impacts_of_minimum_wages_review_of_the_international_evidence_Arindrajit_Dube_web.pdf</ref><ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/labr.12162</ref>. It is important to recognize, however, that these effects vary depending on which study you look at. For example, one study estimated an elasticity of around -0.7. Whether this is due to differences in methodology used, the nature of the markets that the minimum wage changes are situated in, or simply statistical noise, is difficult to say. Still, the evidence is overwhelmingly in support of an elasticity estimate of 0.1<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254583157_Are_the_Effects_of_Minimum_Wage_Increases_Always_Small_New_Evidence_from_a_Case_Study_of_New_York_State</ref>. Additionally, Clemens & Wither (2014) looked at the minimum wage in the context of the great recession, and found a significant negative effect of the minimum wage on employment and income growth<ref>https://www.nber.org/papers/w20724</ref>. Given that recessions are often characterized by low profit margins, it would make sense that firms in labor markets would act in a manner more consistent with the competitive model and end up laying off more workers, reducing their income growth. I would naturally expect that the effects of a minimum wage would thus be worse in the context of a recession, so this result does not surprise me.

There is some literature which looks at the reasons for why this might be the case. One study for example found a substitution effect where highly productive teenagers have increased levels of employment and adults have decreased levels of employment as a result of minimum wages<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254429129_Minimum_Wage_Effects_on_Employment_Substitution_and_the_Teenage_Labor_Supply_Evidence_from_Personnel_Data</ref>. However, given a wealth of data which suggests that teen employment is either unaffected or slightly reduced as a consequence of minimum wages<ref>https://irle.berkeley.edu/files/2011/Do-Minimum-Wages-Really-Reduce-Teen-Employment.pdf</ref><ref>http://tankona.free.fr/nber28399.pdf</ref>, it is unlikely that this is a widespread case, if a case at all.

One study looked at how the minimum wage affects labor markets of different concentrations, and finds that there is variance in the employment effects of the minimum wage and how concentrated a particular labor market is<ref>https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w26101/w26101.pdf</ref>. More concentrated labor markets which would act more monopsonistically have more positive employment effects, whereas less concentrated labor markets which would act more competitively have more negative employment effects. The new effect ends up balancing to zero. This is consistent with the idea that both competitive and monopsonistic models of the minimum wage have some level of merit to them. Moreover, if it is the case that the proportions of differently concentrated labor markets vary across time and geographical region, it could potentially explain the differing results that come up from the minimum wage literature.

Another important question to examine is the long-term effects of minimum wages on unemployment, which there is some data on. It appears that there may be slightly larger long-term effects of the minimum wage on unemployment<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/24736030#metadata_info_tab_contents</ref><ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0019793917692788</ref>, although these are also small.

While it is the case that the empirical evidence suggests little to no adverse effects of the minimum wage on employment, it is nonetheless undeniable that a sufficiently large minimum wage would have adverse employment effects. This is something which both proponents of the competitive and monopsony model can agree on. Because of this, it is useful to examine when a minimum wage goes too far in its adverse effects, Dube (2019) reviewed the literature and found that employment effects appear to be small up until around 59% of the median wage<ref>https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/844350/impacts_of_minimum_wages_review_of_the_international_evidence_Arindrajit_Dube_web.pdf</ref>.

#### Prices

Another important concern is whether minimum wage increases are absorbed by price increases. The majority of the literature suggests that the price increases are fairly small in general<ref>https://docs.iza.org/dp1072.pdf</ref><ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-6419.2007.00532.x</ref><ref>https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2015/Q3/study-raising-wages-to-15-an-hour-for-limited-service-restaurant-employees-would-raise-prices-4.3-percent.html</ref><ref>https://escholarship.org/uc/item/24t5h934</ref><ref>https://gspp.berkeley.edu/assets/uploads/research/pdf/The_Pass-Through_of_Minimum_Wages_into_US_Retail_Price.pdf</ref>. This suggests that minimum wages generally transfer money from firms or consumers to low-income consumers, meaning it is progressive. This appears to depend on the size of the hike, which is consistent with the monopsony model. Small minimum wage hikes do not lead to higher prices, while large minimum wage hikes do<ref>https://research.upjohn.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1278&context=up_workingpapers</ref>.

It should be acknowledged that the distributional effects of the minimum wage when taking this into account are progressive, but fairly small. This is because of the potential negative effects of the minimum wage on employment, the fact that minimum wages affect different income quintiles roughly the same (as the share of families with a minimum wage worker is roughly the same across income quintiles), and the natural price increases from a minimum wage. This translates into a moderate benefit for lower-income consumers but a substantial deadweight loss on the whole<ref>https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/2017-01/BG3160_0.pdf</ref>. This isn't inherently a bad thing, as most taxes in general produce deadweight losses, but it is important to note as a drawback. The effect that a minimum wage hike will have on prices does appear to depend on policy design. Minimum wages indexed to a price measure appear to have a lower pass-through effect<ref>https://research.upjohn.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1278&context=up_workingpapers</ref>. I'd imagine that a minimum wage indexed on the median hourly wage would be similar in effect, and as discussed before, it appears that one pegged to 59% of the median hourly wage would have the greatest positive effect before getting into negative employment effects.

In short, price increases are important to consider but not sufficient to justify the notion that the minimum wage is inherently bad. While I did not find any data pertaining to how price levels would change as a minimum wage continues to increase, I would imagine it'd be roughly similar to the 59% of median wage number that a study found on employment. I suspect this because if employment effects don't become notable until 59% of the median wage, it is likely the case that some monopsonistic effects are operating until roughly that threshold, in which case not only is there less of a necessity to decrease employment at lower minimum wage levels, but there is less of a necessity to engage in other profit-maximizing measures, such as price hikes either. Due to this, I would consider this literature consistent with the idea that a minimum wage should be hiked to be roughly 59% of the median hourly wage.

#### Labor Market Changes

Consistent with the notion that neither the monopsony nor the competitive model can fully explain minimum wage effects, I found fairly contradictory evidence on how labor market flows are affected by the minimum wage, with some research suggesting increased labor market flows<ref>http://sarkoups.free.fr/dustmann719.pdf</ref> and some suggesting decreased labor market flows<ref>https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/685449</ref>. My suspicion is that the effects likely vary by industry and also by location as most minimum wage effects appear to vary. Ku (2020) suggests that the minimum wage increases labor productivity, which could arguably be due to either a monopsony or competitive model<ref>https://docs.iza.org/dp13369.pdf</ref>. I think in either case it makes sense why workers would want to improve their productivity, as they are potentially at risk of being squeezed out of the market, even in some cases with a monopsony model. Research on the levels of absenteeism is also consistent with the idea that workers are likely pressured to some extent as a consequence of minimum wage increases, as they often risk getting unemployed<ref>https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1588294</ref>. The minimum wage also has a variety of other effects on the labor market, which are also due to cost pressures<ref>https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/PA701.pdf</ref>:

*Increasing the likelihood and duration of unemployment for low-wage workers, particularly during economic downturns
*Encouraging employers to cut worker training
*Increasing job turnover
*Discouraging part-time work and reducing school attendance
*Driving workers into uncovered jobs, reducing wages in those sectors
*Encouraging employers to cut back on fringe benefits
*Encouraging employers to install labor-saving devices
*Increasing inflationary pressure
*Increasing teenage crime rates as a result of higher unemployment
*Encouraging workers to hire illegal aliens.
*Another channel of adjustment is labor-labor substitution within businesses, where some employers will replace their lowest-skilled workers with somewhat higher-skilled workers in response to increases in the minimum wage. Unions are strong supporters of minimum wages because of this reduction in competition.

Much of this research is consistent with the competitive model, although results from the monopsonistic model creep in as well. It does appear, however, that the competitive model is better at explaining how channels of adjustment operate following minimum wage hikes.

### Quality of Life Effects

#### Poverty and Wages

Much of the research on the relationship between the minimum wage and poverty/workers wages appears to rest on the debate of how the minimum wage would affect employment. Given the conflicting research on that question, it is of no surprise that there is conflicting research on the issue of how the minimum wage affects poverty and wages<ref>https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/24285/1/dp4298.pdf</ref><ref>https://irle.berkeley.edu/files/2010/Minimum-Wage-Effects-Across-State-Borders.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.hamiltonproject.org/assets/legacy/files/downloads_and_links/state_local_minimum_wage_policy_dube.pdf</ref>. However, if it is the case that the minimum wage has few unemployment effects until a certain threshold, which was established is likely around 59% of the median hourly wage, it stands to reason that poverty would likely decrease until roughly that point, at which it would start to reverse. The specific numbers of this may vary depending on a range of factors, but it makes sense that this would be the case.

Further complicating this issue however is the question of who benefits from the minimum wage, which does seem to be disproportionately the poor as suggested by data on minimum wages and prices<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.4284/sej.2010.76.3.592</ref><ref>https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/PA701.pdf</ref>. However, as stated before the minimum wage is only moderately progressive. If my hypothesis is correct that the effects of the minimum wage is beneficial up until a certain threshold, it would help to explain the generally sympathetic views that economists have towards the minimum wage according to polling<ref>https://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/minimum-wage/</ref>.

#### Wealth Inequality

The minimum wage appears to decrease general income inequality, consistent with the idea that it increases the income of people while having little to no unemployment effects<ref>https://economics.mit.edu/files/11561](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20140073</ref><ref>https://ftp.iza.org/dp10572.pdf</ref>. However, once again, this appears to potentially reverse itself when it reaches a maximum effectiveness value. Litwin (2015) found a result of a maximum effectiveness value of $11.77 across OECD countries<ref>https://cupola.gettysburg.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1388&context=student_scholarship</ref>, which appears roughly consistent with the 59% maximum before large unemployment effects occur. This doesn't mean that all poorer parties benefit. For example, poorer bosses appear to suffer more from the minimum wage<ref>https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/01/04/a-study-suggests-that-higher-minimum-wages-hit-poorer-bosses-pockets</ref>. This is consistent with research shown earlier about how the minimum wage pushes less successful businesses out of the market, given that they have lower profit margins. Still, overall the minimum wage reduces wealth inequality.

#### Health

In general, the minimum wage has been found to have positive health effects, including reduced mortality<ref>https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2016.303188</ref>, suicides<ref>https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w25787/w25787.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/01/20/higher-minimum-wages-are-linked-to-lower-suicide-rates</ref>, and BMI<ref>https://journalistsresource.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/w15485.pdf</ref>, as well as increased subjective well-being<ref>https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/blogs.baylor.edu/dist/2/1297/files/2010/09/Minimum_Wage_SWB_3.7.16_PF-293y1ob.pdf</ref> and life expectancy<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27844176/</ref>. This is consistent with the idea that the minimum wage generally alleviates economic hardship for those who are most at risk of poor health conditions in society.

#### Education

There is research suggesting that minimum wage increases have a small but positive impact on education<ref>https://journalistsresource.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/w16355.pdf</ref>. Given that the posited mechanism for this result is that unemployment increases as a consequence of the minimum wage which causes teenagers to become more educated to increase their job prospects, I'd imagine this is generally a null or small effect.

#### Crime

Research on crime suggests that the minimum wage can have positive or negative effects on crime, depending on whether the increase has notable effects on the unemployment rate relative to the wage increase<ref>https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/page/files/20160423_cea_incarceration_criminal_justice.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w25116/w25116.pdf</ref><ref>https://epionline.org/app/uploads/2019/03/EPI_MinimumWageReducingCrimeStudy_Final-2.pdf</ref>. Due to this, it is likely the case that crime effects are roughly positive or null until the 59% threshold outlined earlier.

### Other Economic Effects

Due to causing increases in spending, a minimum wage hike appears to increase economic growth<ref>https://www.epi.org/publication/raising-federal-minimum-wage-to-1010/</ref><ref>https://www.nber.org/papers/w25761#:~:text=Using%20variation%20in%20minimum%20wages,and%20nominal%20spending%20rise%20modestly.</ref>. As with policies which increase aggregate spending in general, however, this is likely to be a short-term effect of a hike as opposed to a long-term consequence of having a minimum wage in place. In the long-term, it is likely the case that a minimum wage has roughly null effects on economic growth.

### Racism

Historically, minimum wage laws have been advocated by some as a means to push black people out of the labor market through increasing the pressure of businesses to reduce their employment of low-skilled labor, which was and still is disproportionately black<ref>https://mises.org/wire/racist-history-minimum-wage-laws</ref>.

Interestingly however, these policies appear to have had the opposite effect that was expected. While I have previously documented research on the effects of the minimum wage on broad inequality, there is also some on racial inequality specifically, which finds that minimum wages have reduced racial inequality where implemented<ref>https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/136/1/169/5905427</ref><ref>https://irle.berkeley.edu/racial-inequality-and-minimum-wages-in-frictional-labor-markets/</ref>. Therefore, it is more accurate to suggest that a minimum wage reduces racism rather than exacerbating it, although I would argue this shouldn't be framed in terms of racism.

### In Developing Countries

An interesting question to examine is how the minimum wage would work in developing countries which are characterized by significantly higher levels of low-wage labor. In these contexts, the minimum wage also appears to be effective in reducing poverty<ref>https://wol.iza.org/articles/introducing-a-statutory-minimum-wage-in-middle-and-low-income-countries</ref><ref>https://wol.iza.org/articles/does-increasing-the-minimum-wage-reduce-poverty-in-developing-countries/long</ref>. As for the threshold of a minimum wage, I'd imagine 59% of the median wage could work, although I am not super confident on this just due to how these types of labor markets likely operate significantly differently compared to those in developed countries where minimum wage effects are typically studied. Importantly, institutional mechanisms must be in place to actually enforce a minimum wage in order for it to be effective, which is a concern in developing countries where rule of law is more questionable in some contexts to say the least.

## Welfare State

The effects of an expanded welfare state, usually measured in the form of social spending, have been studied extensively:

- **Poverty -** Higher social spending is a major predictor of cross-national rates of poverty, with higher social spending reducing poverty significantly in terms of both absolute and relative measures of poverty<ref>http://www.lisdatacenter.org/wps/liswps/188.pdf</ref><ref>http://www2.hawaii.edu/~noy/300texts/poverty-comparative.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20070213-3.pdf</ref><ref>https://files.epi.org/2012/ib339-us-poverty-higher-safety-net-weaker.pdf</ref><ref>https://odi.org/en/publications/cash-transfers-what-does-the-evidence-say-a-rigorous-review-of-impacts-and-the-role-of-design-and-implementation-features/</ref>.
- **Crime -** higher expenditures on a variety of different social programs have all been associated with significant drops in crime<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/3097192</ref><ref>https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/7/10/e016379.full.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047235220300623#:~:text=The%20welfare%20state%20suppresses%20crime,have%20any%20effect%20on%20homicide.</ref><ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/coep.12522</ref>.
- **Physical Health -** Research suggests that countries with higher minimum income benefits tend to do better in terms of mortality, age standardized death rates, and life expectancy<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262230551_Welfare_states_and_population_health_The_role_of_minimum_income_benefits_for_mortality</ref><ref>https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/jbeckfield/files/beckfield_and_bambra_2016.pdf</ref>. Moreover, as welfare state generosity increases, citizens find life more rewarding<ref>https://www.academia.edu/9138840/The_Welfare_State_and_Quality_of_Life_A_Cross-National_Analysis</ref>. This is intuitively true as people with less income gain more from each dollar than people with more income, which suggests that welfare programs (which naturally decrease wealth inequality) would increase happiness<ref>https://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2289&context=bclr</ref>.
- **Mental Health -** While there is a stigma surrounding welfare uptake<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/30011810</ref><ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/14265381_Welfare_Participation_and_Self-Esteem_in_Later_Life</ref>, evidence suggests that the mental health of people who are in need increases when they are given welfare<ref>https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/185890</ref><ref>https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/THE-SHORT-TERM-IMPACT-OF-UNCONDITIONAL-CASH-TO-THE-Haushofer-Shapiro/261e2442f2b293c05e40d6b9d481ab32d2bcc250?p2df</ref>.
- **Social Trust -** Nordic countries are characterized by high trust, which benefits the economy and has social benefits. This is in part due to their welfare state and education<ref>https://norden.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1095959/FULLTEXT02.pdf</ref>.
- **Nutrition/Growth -** Welfare, particularly food stamps, improves nutritional quality<ref>https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/13244/755330REVISED000Revised0June0402014.pdf</ref><ref>https://gspp.berkeley.edu/assets/uploads/research/pdf/Hoynes-Schanzenbach-Almond-AER-2016.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6022372/</ref>, as well as improving child physical development<ref>https://odi.org/en/publications/cash-transfers-what-does-the-evidence-say-a-rigorous-review-of-impacts-and-the-role-of-design-and-implementation-features/</ref>.
- **Work Incentives and Unemployment -** The effects of social spending on employment are mixed but generally there is a small or null effect<ref>https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/95374/1/472529528.pdf</ref><ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00148-012-0458-0</ref><ref>https://odi.org/en/publications/cash-transfers-what-does-the-evidence-say-a-rigorous-review-of-impacts-and-the-role-of-design-and-implementation-features/</ref><ref>https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/remahanna/files/151016_labor_supply_paper_draft_final.pdf</ref>. Welfare recipients have no differences in attitudes or political beliefs compared to non-recipients, suggesting that there is no culture of dependence that is developed from being on welfare<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/4092339?mag=welfare-dependency&seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents</ref>. Furthermore, employment commitment appears to increase in more generous welfare states<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0950017014542499</ref><ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/26499235</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/03/150331074345.htm</ref>.
- **Economic Growth -** The effects of social spending on economic growth are mixed and highly heterogeneous depending on which studies are looked at<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/056943459604000202</ref>. Tomassi (2013) suggests that the level of social spending alone is not sufficient to determine the impact on economic performance, but how the welfare system is designed and structured<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/293824842_When_is_social_protection_productivity-enhancing_Costs_and_benefits_on_economic_performances</ref>. Furceri & Zdzienicka (2012) found a short-term multiplier effect of social spending on economic activity<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1475-5890.2012.00155.x</ref>, but Churchill & Yew (2017) did a meta-analysis and found that government transfers are more detrimental to economic growth in developed countries as opposed to less-developed countries<ref>https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ecmode/v64y2017icp270-287.html</ref>. Part of the effect may be due to whether it is looking from a short-term versus long-term perspective. Social welfare schemes may be good in economic downturns.
- **Crowding Out -** While a crowding out effect potentially exists between welfare and charitable donations, meta-analytic evidence suggests that it is far from a 1:1 crowding out effect, suggesting there is not perfect substitution between social spending and voluntary charitable donations<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Arjen-De-Wit/publication/298709903_Government_Support_and_Charitable_Donations_A_Meta-Analysis_of_the_Crowding-out_Hypothesis/links/5a6cd604a6fdcc317b17cc03/Government-Support-and-Charitable-Donations-A-Meta-Analysis-of-the-Crowding-out-Hypothesis.pdf</ref>.
- **Familial Effects -** Most studies looking at the United States suggest that welfare has a negative effect on marriage and a positive effect on fertility<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK230345/</ref>, although a notable minority of studies find no relation at all and there is significant variation in findings. However, research looking at OECD member countries in general suggests that an expansion in the welfare state, while increasing fertility, also increases marriage and divorce rates with a stronger effect on marriage, suggesting that welfare states support family formation<ref>https://ftp.iza.org/dp7210.pdf</ref>. This may be due to the structure of the American welfare system, as for example in the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program there is a requirement that the program provides cash support only to children living without at least one of their biological parents. Medicaid has historically been made available primarily to AFDC recipients and housing programs also tend to have preferences for AFDC recipients, thus having the same bias toward single-parent families<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK230345/</ref>. The American Food Stamp Program (FSP), which did not have the same bias toward single-parent families, was found to improve birth outcomes amongst those who were exposed to the program three months before birth<ref>https://direct.mit.edu/rest/article-abstract/93/2/387/58599/Inside-the-War-on-Poverty-The-Impact-of-Food</ref>. In sum, welfare does not necessarily have negative familial effects but can in fact promote family creation. However, if eligibility requirements for benefits include familial structure, as was the case in the United States, it can have negative familial effects.
- **Consumption of Drugs/Temptation Goods -** World Bank (2014) reviewed the literature on the effect of cash transfers on the consumption of temptation goods and found that cash transfers had no effect on the consumption of temptation goods or ended up reducing it<ref>https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/617631468001808739/pdf/WPS6886.pdf</ref>.

**EITC > Minimum Wage** The minimum wage is worse at affecting poverty compared to an earned income tax credit, because it does not target households in need as well and the EITC increases labor force participation and employment<ref>https://wol.iza.org/articles/minimum-wage-versus-earned-income-tax-credit-for-reducing-poverty</ref>.

**The Universality Question** Universal benefits from an accounting perspective are effectively the same as means-tested benefits because they can always do a progressive income tax which has the same effect as a progressive means-tested income distribution program<ref>https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2022/11/11/universal-benefits-cost-less-than-means-tested-benefits/</ref>.

**Unified Analysis** The marginal value of public funds of various government policies is highest in direct investments on low-income children, including child health insurance expansions and college policies. These tend to pay for themselves. For policies targeting adults, they tend to involve budgetary tradeoffs as they cost the government on net. Expenditures on adults can have high MVPFs if they have spillover effects on children<ref>https://www.policyinsights.org/</ref>.

## Monetary/Fiscal Policy

Quantitative easing tends to ease financial conditions and support economic growth, and can be especially powerful during times of financial stress<ref>https://www.piie.com/publications/policy-briefs/quantitative-easing-underappreciated-success</ref>.

## Innovation

Innovation primarily comes from universities and federal laboratories, and is primarily collaborative<ref>https://itif.org/files/Where_do_innovations_come_from.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmsa1008268</ref>.

Patent rights have a positive effect on innovation<ref>https://0x0.la/u/K9fgvb6.pdf</ref>.

## Poverty

Winners of lotteries in the 1800s, although having slightly more children than non-winners, did not send them to school more. Sons of winners had no better outcomes in terms of education, income, or literacy<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5436311/</ref>.

## Regulation

Low regulation and pro-market attitudes have a positive effect on life satisfaction<ref>https://sci-hub.se/10.1080/13504851.2012.762709</ref>.

Regulation creates significant costs to the economy<ref>https://fee.org/articles/the-poverty-of-regulation/</ref><ref>https://www.mercatus.org/publications/regulation/cumulative-cost-regulations</ref>.

Regulation is associated with an increased poverty rate<ref>https://www.mercatus.org/publications/regulation/regulation-and-poverty</ref>.

Regulations promote higher consumer prices, which have a disproportionately negative effect on low-income households<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11127-017-0479-z</ref>.

Regulations tend to have regressive effects on low-wage workers, as even if their wages do not directly decrease due to regulation, their wages fall relative to those of managers and accountants in regulated industries<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11127-018-0517-5</ref>.

More-regulated industries experience fewer new firm births and slower employment growth. Firms may even successfully lobby government officials to increase regulations to raise their smaller rivals' costs. In fact, regulations inhibit employment growth in small firms more than in large firms<ref>https://www.mercatus.org/system/files/Bailey-Regulation-Entrepreneurship.pdf</ref>.

An increase in regulatory restrictions on a particular industry is associated with a reduction in the total number of small firms within that industry, without any association with the number of large firms in that industry<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325330609_Regulation_Entrepreneurship_and_Firm_Size</ref>.

Regulatory growth increases operating costs per unit of output<ref>https://www.mercatus.org/system/files/fullenbaum-regulatory-growth-mercatus-working-paper-v1.pdf</ref>.

Around the world, stricter regulation tends to increase unemployment. Tight hiring and firing rules and military conscription most clearly appear to have adverse effects<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596708000772</ref>.

Anticompetitive business regulations such as price controls and administrative obstacles to starting a new business appear to lower labor force participation and employment rates<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0148619508000337</ref>.

There is a weak but positive effect of financial liberalization on growth on average<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0261560612002033</ref>.

## Poverty

A $100,000 increase in housing wealth among homeowners causes a 16-18% increase in the probability of having a child<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1162/REST_a_00266</ref>.

## Big Government

Fiscal policy or public spending has a sizable negative effect on profits and business investment<ref>https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/00028280260136255</ref>.

There is a robust negative effect of government spending and taxation on economic growth in rich countries, based on a sample during the period of 1970-95<ref>https://www.ifn.se/Wfiles/wp/wp503.pdf</ref>.

Government size negatively correlates with growth when controlling for economic freedom and globalization<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11127-009-9484-1</ref>.

## Healthcare

Veterans affairs healthcare generally performs similarly or better than non veterans affairs healthcare<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5215146/</ref>.

Longer healthcare wait times are associated with greater risk of mortality<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1955366/</ref><ref>https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/effect-of-wait-times-on-mortality-in-canada.pdf</ref><ref>https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2664460</ref>.

Public healthcare in low and middle-income countries was less efficient than private healthcare, but private healthcare had worse patient outcomes and more frequently violated medical standards of practice<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3378609/</ref>.

The US spends far more on healthcare than other high-income countries, but their quality of care is worse notably in terms of mortality amenable to health. Universality appears to be the best way to improve healthcare, although there is diversity in how that is achieved<ref>https://interactives.commonwealthfund.org/2017/july/mirror-mirror/</ref>.

Single-payer healthcare financing in the US has been found in the majority of studies to amount to a net savings in the long-run<ref>https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1003013</ref>.

Direct government funding is more important in the development of the most innovative new drugs, than it is for standard drugs. Government funding has played an indirect role by funding basic underlying research that is built on in almost half of the drugs approved and in almost 2/3rds of priority-review drugs<ref>https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2009.0917</ref>.

US pharmaceutical innovation is not exceptionally good compared to other countries as a proportion of its GDP and many countries with drug price regulation are significant contributors to pharmaceutical innovation<ref>https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2009.178491</ref>.

Lack of health insurance is associated with mortality<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2775760/</ref>. Numerous studies have estimates that tens of thousands of deaths in the US are due to a lack of health insurance<ref>https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2009/09/new-study-finds-45000-deaths-annually-linked-to-lack-of-health-coverage/</ref><ref>https://www.cbpp.org/sites/default/files/atoms/files/11-6-19health.pdf</ref>, although Kronick (2009) finds that there is no relationship between insurance and mortality risk after adjusting for demographic, health status, and health behavior characteristics<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2739025/</ref>. This study however appears to suffer from the sociologist's fallacy.

## Rent Control

Rent control does a poor job at targeting benefits to those who need them. Residents of rent-controlled units are less likely to move, meaning they often continue to live in houses that don't properly fit their needs. Rent control and rent stabilization policies also reduce the available supply of housing, which generally leads to higher rents in the uncontrolled market. There are also significant fiscal costs associated with implementing rent control and no consistent relationship between rent control and the prevalence of homelessness. There is also no substantial evidence supporting the idea that rent control decreases economic or racial segregation<ref>https://www.nmhc.org/globalassets/knowledge-library/rent-control-literature-review-final2.pdf</ref>.

## Housing First

The Finnish national program to reduce homelessness started in 2008 and renewed in 2012 built on housing first. This was a broad partnership between the national and municipal authorities and the non-profit sector, where Finland converted shelters into apartment units and constructed housing. Clients have a choice of programs, some of which ask for a commitment to sobriety, while others do not. Instead of receiving housing subsidies linked to the rent of the apartment, tenants pay for the entire rent using government-provided income sources, such as housing, child, disability, unemployment, student, and pension allowances, depending on the person's circumstances. If these don't suffice, social assistance fills the gap. To prevent conflict between tenants, tenants engage in "neighborhood work". This program led to homelessness largely ending<ref>https://0x0.la/u/w4UVmBP.pdf</ref>. While the Finnish housing interventions cost money, they save money in terms of the services needed by one person. Finland has a very low homeless population because they give people houses first as opposed to expecting people to sort their problems out before getting a home. Rents are paid for by the government, although the tenants can pay a portion depending on their income. Moreover, on top of this, to drive down housing costs, Finland has increased the supply of affordable rental housing to counter housing shortages<ref>https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/02/how-finland-solved-homelessness/</ref>.

Medicine Hat practiced housing first and became the first city in Canada to end chronic homelessness<ref>https://community.solutions/case-studies/medicine-hat-becomes-first-city-in-canada-to-end-chronic-homelessness/</ref>, although it lasted only 5 months. As of 2022, the number of people chronically rose to 19<ref>https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/homeless-medicine-hat-point-in-time-count-1.6600717</ref>.

## Housing Regulation

Housing regulation is a significant contributor to high house prices<ref>https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w10124/w10124.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.nahb.org/blog/2021/05/regulatory-costs-add-a-whopping-93870-to-new-home-prices/</ref><ref>https://www.vtpi.org/park-hou.pdf</ref>.

## Inheritance Taxation

Inheritance taxation can reduce wealth inequality. It has been argued that it leads to businesses, particularly small businesses, going bankrupt due to inheritances following taxation being insufficient to continue a business. However, heirs are generally poorer at managing businesses so inheritance taxation can help reduce skills-capital mismatch<ref>https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/inheritance-taxation-in-oecd-countries_6315055c-en</ref>.

## Zoning

In most places, housing costs are close to the marginal physical costs of new construction, meaning that physical costs in most cases have little to do with relatively high prices. Zoning has instead been found to be consistently associated with decreased affordability<ref>https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w8835/w8835.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/zoning-land-use-planning-housing-affordability</ref>.

## Unions

Unionization reduces aggregate poverty<ref>https://www.cepr.net/unions-the-best-fix-to-poverty/</ref><ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0003122413501859</ref><ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00197939211014855</ref>, as well as income inequality<ref>https://www.asanet.org/sites/default/files/savvy/images/journals/docs/pdf/asr/WesternandRosenfeld.pdf</ref><ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0891242416634852</ref>.

Right to work laws make it illegal for a group of unionized workers to negotiate a contract that requires each employee who enjoys the benefits of the contract terms to pay their share of costs for negotiating and policing the contract. These result in decreased wages<ref>https://www.epi.org/publication/bp299/</ref>, and also increase economic inequality indirectly by lowering labor power resources<ref>https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/708067</ref>.

Doucouliagos & Laroche (2003) conducted a meta-analysis and found that after controlling for differences between studies, a negative association was discovered between unions and productivity in the UK, while a positive relationship was found in the US<ref>https://library.fes.de/libalt/journals/swetsfulltext/17556769.pdf</ref>. An additional bootstrapped meta-analysis also found a positive relationship in the US<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227640784_What_Do_Unions_Do_to_Productivity_A_Meta-Analysis</ref>. A more recent meta-analysis also suggested that unions are not invariably harmful to productivity, although the impact may depend on a number of factors including the sectors and counties concerned, the time period investigated and institutional settings such as labor market regulation<ref>https://tuac.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Recent-Meta-20Dec17.pdf</ref>.

## Worker Ownership

Codetermination laws are negatively associated with productivity, but profit-sharing, worker ownership, and worker participation in decision-making are all positively associated with productivity. All of these are stronger in labor-managed firms compared with participatory capitalist firms<ref>https://library.uniteddiversity.coop/Cooperatives/Worker_Participation_and_Productivity-Meta_Analysis.pdf</ref>.

Worker cooperatives aren't rare because they are inefficient, but because they are less likely to start up. From the ground, this is due to wealth and credit constraints, entrepreneurial rents, and collective action problems. However, this does not explain why existing firms do not convert to worker cooperatives<ref>https://institute.coop/sites/default/files/resources/070%202013_Olsen_The%20Relative%20Survival%20of%20Worker%20Cooperatives%20and%20Barriers%20to%20Their%20Creation.pdf</ref>.

Worker cooperatives have survival rates at least as good if not better than participatory capitalist firms<ref>https://www.uk.coop/sites/default/files/2020-10/worker_co-op_report.pdf</ref>. This is explained by their greater employment stability<ref>https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1016/S0885-3339(04)08001-9/full/html</ref>.

Employee ownership has a positive and statistically significant relation to firm performance<ref>https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w5277/w5277.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304459942_Employee_ownership_and_firm_performance_a_meta-analysis_Employee_ownership_a_meta-analysis</ref>.

Codetermination rights lead to higher income equality<ref>https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/publications/wp/wp-147.pdf#page=4</ref>.

## Trade and Globalization

While there is publication bias in the literature, even correcting for publication bias economic globalization has a positive effect on economic growth, although this is primarily driven by trade globalization. Financial globalization may have zero effect<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/twec.13235</ref>.

International trade regulation can create jobs in the sectors it protects or promotes, but almost always at the expense of destroying a roughly equivalent number of jobs elsewhere in the economy<ref>https://wol.iza.org/articles/international-trade-regulation-and-job-creation</ref>.

## Misc. Economics

Literacy and numeracy have substantial economic value. More years in education alone does not improve this economic value, but it must be combined with a rigorous evaluation and curriculum<ref>https://wol.iza.org/articles/what-is-economic-value-of-literacy-and-numeracy</ref>.

Overeducation and skill mismatches result in labor market mismatches. Overskilling decreases job satisfaction and lowers productivity. Policy should ensure that education must integrate with skill formation outside the workplace, in case overproduction of formal education interacts negatively with skill formation<ref>https://wol.iza.org/articles/overeducation-skill-mismatches-and-labor-market-outcomes-for-college-graduates</ref>.

It may be necessary for countries such as the US to have more inequality if it means it allows for innovation which other countries can benefit from<ref>https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/jrobinson/files/varieties_of_capitalism_april_9_2013.pdf</ref>.

## Colonialism/Slavery

Colonial European settlement had a positive impact on the economic development of colonies. This was likely because any adverse effect of extractive institutions associated with minority European settlement was offset by other things settlers brought such as human capital and technology<ref>https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w12546/w12546.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w18162/w18162.pdf</ref>.

Slavery use in the Americas was negatively correlated with subsequent economic development<ref>https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/nunn/files/domestic_slavery.pdf</ref>.

Higher colonial income-adjusted revenue levels during the early 20th century can be linked to higher government quality today, suggesting that the current institutional success of former colonies can be traced back to the extent of historical revenue extraction<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305750X16304855</ref>.

## Immigration

### Economic Effects

#### Growth

Immigration is positively associated with economic growth per person<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165176505002594</ref>, with the majority of research suggesting that immigration causes higher economic growth per person<ref>https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/DOES-IMMIGRATION-HAVE-AN-IMPACT-ON-ECONOMIC-AND-Feridun/d28ac1f06ddca71a6b4d22a33467ab40e23e22de</ref><ref>https://doi.org/10.1111/labr.12017</ref>. This is because immigration increases labor supply, human capital accumulation, savings rate, total factor productivity, and technological progress<ref>https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-77796-0_9</ref><ref>https://doi.org/10.3386/W15507</ref><ref>https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC109196</ref>. Immigration also tends to increase the business failure rate, which leads to higher levels of entrepreneurship and a more dynamic economy<ref>https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JEPP-01-2015-0002/full/html</ref>. High-skilled immigration creates positive spillover effects for innovation in the economy Highly-skilled immigrants have positive spillovers for innovation in the economy<ref>https://sci-hub.se/10.1007/s10109-010-0111-y</ref>. To maximize economic benefits, governments should have economic integration policies to ease transfer of foreign human capital<ref>https://wol.iza.org/articles/skill-based-immigration-economic-integration-and-economic-performance</ref>.

#### Labor Market

The overall evidence suggests that immigrants have a small negative aggregate effect on native employment and wages in the short run<ref>https://research.vu.nl/en/publications/a-meta-analytic-assessment-of-the-effect-of-immigration-on-wages-3</ref><ref>https://sci-hub.se/10.1007/s10109-010-0111-y</ref><ref>https://wol.iza.org/articles/do-migrants-take-the-jobs-of-native-workers</ref><ref>https://lem.univ-lille.fr/fileadmin/user_upload/laboratoires/lem/doc_de_travail_2021/DT2021-04.pdf</ref>, and a positive effect on both in the long run following labor market adjustment<ref>https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/10.1111/joes.12300</ref>. This short-term negative effect is not distributed evenly across the entire economy but is concentrated in the industries where the immigrants are concentrated in<ref>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00380237.2013.766834</ref>, which is commonly but not always in low-skill industries<ref>https://cis.org/sites/cis.org/files/articles/1998/wagestudy/wages.pdf</ref><ref>https://economics.nd.edu/assets/263109/jmp_turner.pdf</ref>. Immigration may also improve the health of native workers<ref>https://wol.iza.org/articles/do-immigrants-improve-health-of-native-workers</ref>.

#### Fiscal

Most research suggests that the net fiscal impact of immigration is highly varied but generally zero<ref>https://www.oecd.org/els/mig/IMO-2013-chap3-fiscal-impact-of-immigration.pdf</ref><ref>http://cdn-odi-production.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/media/documents/fiscal_space_paper_final.pdf</ref>. However, this is dependent on the policy environment, including the extent to which labor markets absorb migrants, the informality of labor markets and migrants' rights to work and receive welfare benefits. It is also dependent on the age of immigrants and their migration category. Labor/highly educated migrants tend to have a higher fiscal position than humanitarian migrants for example due to their more favorable labor market outcomes<ref>https://doi.org/10.1086/654705</ref><ref>https://www.oecd.org/els/mig/IMO-2013-chap3-fiscal-impact-of-immigration.pdf</ref><ref>http://cdn-odi-production.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/media/documents/fiscal_space_paper_final.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/institute/working-papers/17-13.pdf</ref>. Refugee or non-western immigration has been almost unanimously shown to have a negative effect on the fiscal balance<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecoj.12181</ref><ref>https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/https://doi.org/10.1111/imig.12520</ref>. With proper integration of refugees however, it is possible that the fiscal gains in the long-term due to refugees contributing to the economy may significantly outweigh the short-term costs<ref>https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/sites/futurium/files/jrc107441_wp_kancs_and_lecca_2017_4.pdf</ref>.

More welfare generosity predicts increased international migration to a country, an effect known as the welfare magnet effect<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818800000405</ref><ref>https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4698/8/3/83/htm</ref><ref>https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/IJM-10-2017-0274/full/html</ref><ref>https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w26454/w26454.pdf</ref>.

#### Inflation

In general, immigration tends to reduce prices with the exception of housing prices<ref>https://sci-hub.se/10.1007/s10109-010-0111-y</ref><ref>https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/741926/Final_EEA_report.PDF</ref>. Data from meta-analyses suggest that immigration on the aggregate increases home prices<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137718302481#:~:text=Using%20an%20instrumental%20variables%20strategy,locating%20in%20the%20same%20provinces.</ref>. For example, Cochrane & Poot (2021) finds that a 1% increase in immigration in a city increases rents by 0.5-1%, with the effect on prices being about double of that<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/347406420_Effects_of_Immigration_on_Local_Housing_Markets</ref>. Nonetheless, the effect can vary in part due to the degree to which natives respond by moving from areas that migrants settle in. However, because in the long-run wages of natives rise on average due to immigration, the average rent burden does not change<ref>https://sci-hub.se/10.1007/s10109-010-0111-y</ref>.

#### Inequality

Immigration tends to increase population-level socioeconomic inequality, although it does not increase native wage inequality<ref>https://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/immigration-and-inequality.pdf</ref><ref>https://openpsych.net/files/papers/Kirkegaard_2015a.pdf</ref>.

### Social Effects

#### Crime

The overall research suggests that there is a negative immigration-crime association, but one which is very weak and has significant variation across studies<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235261537_Immigration_reduces_crime_An_emerging_scholarly_consensus</ref><ref>https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-criminol-032317-092026</ref>. This is unlikely to be due to reporting bias, as there is a high degree of correspondence between self-reports of arrest and official reports of arrest amongst immigrants, suggesting their lower levels of offending are not due to under-reporting<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10940-016-9314-9</ref>.

Correlates of immigrant crime include national IQs and Islam prevalence in the home countries<ref>https://openpsych.net/paper/14/</ref><ref>https://openpsych.net/paper/13/</ref><ref>https://openpsych.net/paper/50/</ref>, whether the immigrants are disproportionately young and male<ref>https://files.catbox.moe/zehcls.pdf</ref>, and the degree to which the increase in immigrant population increases ethnic diversity/heterogeneity<ref>https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-19950-4_14</ref><ref>https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:684766</ref><ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0022427817696955</ref>.

#### Political

Immigration to the US is negatively associated with republican vote share<ref>https://files.catbox.moe/6zjldh.pdf</ref> and immigration status positively predicts democratic affiliation<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ssqu.12621</ref>. However, while this is a net effect favoring more left-wing ideologies, natives tend to respond to immigration through support for extreme right political parties and a more protectionist response to immigration<ref>https://www.sv.uio.no/esop/english/research/news-and-events/events/conferences-and-seminars/2015/Docs/skillcell.pdf</ref><ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/imig.12409</ref>.

#### Educational

Higher concentration has a negative or null effect on the educational outcomes of native children<ref>https://wol.iza.org/articles/immigrants-in-classroom-and-effects-on-native-children</ref>. The negative effects tend to be small, vary by country, and seem to be related to disadvantaged immigrants or refugees. This may be remedied by improving support and immigrant children's language acquisition.
Immigration tends to lead to a schooling choice flight amongst students<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775716301789</ref>. This tends to increase school segregation, with wealthier locals being more likely to opt out of private schooling into private schools<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11113-007-9035-8</ref><ref>https://docs.iza.org/dp3946.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002205311300121X</ref>. Immigration also leads to a decrease in public education expenditures<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272711000788</ref>, with Speciale (2012) estimating that the elasticity of education spending with respect to immigrant population share is -0.15<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272712000382</ref>.

### Public Opinion

People tend to favor restrictive immigration policies, particularly against immigrants of different ethnicities. Concerns about ethnic and cultural identity play a stronger role than economic concerns in driving these attitudes<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/4497304</ref><ref>https://wol.iza.org/articles/public-attitudes-toward-immigration-determinants-and-unknowns</ref>.

Immigration policy preferences regarding which types of immigrants should be let in tend to be based on accurate stereotypes about immigrants themselves<ref>https://openpsych.net/files/papers/Carl_2016b.pdf</ref><ref>https://files.catbox.moe/tf1f6n.pdf</ref>.

Contact tends to reduce immigration-related fears for left-leaning but not right-leaning voters<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0010414017740590</ref>.

Natives tend to support redistribution less when the share of immigrants in their resident region is higher. This effect is driven by areas with large welfare states and by centrist or rightist respondents<ref>https://docs.iza.org/dp12130.pdf</ref>.

Exposure to refugee arrivals induces sizable and lasting increases in natives' hostility toward refugees and immigrants and support for restrictive asylum and immigration policies<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1017/S0003055418000813</ref>. Similarly research in Australia has suggested that Australians living in electoral districts with higher percentages of non-white immigrants are more likely to want lower immigrant numbers than those living in districts with fewer non-white immigrants<ref>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10361146.2018.1450357</ref>.

### Brain Drain

Brain drain, the phenomenon of educated people leaving poorer countries to go to richer countries where they will find better economic opportunities. In poor countries, brain drain can change the skill structure of the labor force, cause labor shortages, and affect fiscal policy, but can also generate remittances and other benefits from expatriates and returnees. In spite of remittances, evidence suggests there are many more losers than winners among developing countries. Whether a country gains or loses depends on country-specific factors, such as level and composition of migration, the country's level of development, population size, language, and geographic location. Brain drain appears to decrease with economic development<ref>https://wol.iza.org/articles/brain-drain-from-developing-countries</ref>.

### Immigration Enforcement

Regulations on immigration in general have a significant effect on immigration flows, suggesting that states are able to control their borders<ref>https://ejpr.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1475-6765.12279</ref>. Enforcement of immigration, whether it be on the border or interior of a country, reduces the probability that an individual will decide to illegally migrate<ref>https://wol.iza.org/articles/enforcement-and-illegal-migration</ref>. However, immigration enforcement is costly to the government, decreases the labor force, reduces real GDP, and has no meaningful effects on crime<ref>https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/680935?journalCode=jle</ref><ref>https://www.americanactionforum.org/research/the-budgetary-and-economic-costs-of-addressing-unauthorized-immigration-alt/</ref>.

## Unsorted

Colonies held for longer periods of time than other countries tend to perform better on average after independence<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/30024490#metadata_info_tab_contents</ref>.

Bertocchi & Canova (1996) found that economic growth was faster for dependencies than colonies in Africa, and that on average African growth accelerates after decolonization<ref>https://crei.cat/wp-content/uploads/users/working-papers/colonization.pdf</ref>.

The British industrial revolution passed through a two-stage evolution of inequality. In the first half of the 19th century, wages stagnated while productivity and profit expanded. In the middle of the 19th century, real wages began to grow in line with productivity. Technological progress appears to be the prime mover behind the industrial revolution, which required capital accumulation. The rise in profits financed the necessary capital accumulation to achieve this, and once accumulation caught up with the requirements of technology wages rose in line with productivity<ref>https://ideas.repec.org/p/oxf/wpaper/315.html</ref>.
